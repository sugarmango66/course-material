In this course you'll learn how to create software systems consisting of two parts: a client application and a server application. It will be very similar to how traditional web applications works, but in this course we will focus on implementing an API on the server any type of client can use to communicate with it (such as a smartphone application), and not only web browsers. And to practice on using APIs you'll also learn how to create Single-Page Applications using a frontend framework.</p>\n<div class=\"custom-container warning\"><p class=\"custom-container-title\">Note to old students</p>\n<p>If you're an old student that took this course a previous year but still have some examination tests left to pass you take those tests as they are described in this year's instructions.</p>\n</div>\n","import { render } from \"./index.html.vue?vue&type=template&id=e2ca9106\"\nconst script = {}\n\nimport exportComponent from \"C:\\\\Users\\\\peter\\\\projects\\\\course-material\\\\node_modules\\\\vue-loader\\\\dist\\\\exportHelper.js\"\nconst __exports__ = /*#__PURE__*/exportComponent(script, [['render',render]])\n\nexport default __exports__","\"use strict\";\nObject.defineProperty(exports, \"__esModule\", { value: true });\n// runtime helper for setting properties on components\n// in a tree-shakable way\nexports.default = (sfc, props) => {\n    const target = sfc.__vccOpts || sfc;\n    for (const [key, val] of props) {\n        target[key] = val;\n    }\n    return target;\n};\n","export const data = {\n  \"key\": \"v-214397d1\",\n  \"path\": \"/courses/client-server-communication/\",\n  \"title\": \"Welcome!\",\n  \"lang\": \"en-US\",\n  \"frontmatter\": {},\n  \"excerpt\": \"\",\n  \"headers\": [],\n  \"filePathRelative\": \"courses/client-server-communication/README.md\",\n  \"git\": {\n    \"updatedTime\": 1637833218000\n  }\n}\n"],"names":["id","tabindex","class","href","script","exports","sfc","props","target","__vccOpts","key","val","data"],"sourceRoot":""}
