Try to be creative and come up with an application someone wants to use, i.e. an application that solves a real-world problem of some kind. You could for example create an application for an organization you are member of (e.g. a football organization that needs to keep track of members, leaders, teams, training sessions, etc.), or simply an application you would like to use yourself. You can also try asking your family and friends if they need an Android application with some functionality that doesn&#39;t exist today.</p><p>Another way to come up with an application is to think of something you find boring/dangerous/time consuming, and then try to make it fun/safe/avoid it completely by using an Android application. For example, most people find it boring to wait in line. Maybe you can create an application that makes it fun to wait in line? Or an application that entirely eliminates the need to wait in line?</p><h3 id="suggestions" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#suggestions" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Suggestions</h3><p>At the bottom of this page you find the chapter <em>Project idea: Flee Market Manager</em> that describes a real-world problem you can try to solve by creating an Android application. It can also be used as a guideline for how &quot;complicated&quot;/&quot;complex&quot; the application you create needs to be.</p><p>Another idea is to create an application that can control an embedded system of some kind (dish washer, microwave, robot vacuum cleaner, etc.), for example using Bluetooth. Feel free to create your own embedded system. It can for example be a simple prototype used as a proof of concept. For example, your application might be about controlling a smart lock on a door (a lock that can be locked/unlocked with a smartphone using Bluetooth), but you don&#39;t have any smart lock, so then you create your own embedded system that simulates one, e.g. one that consists of a Bluetooth module and a LED lamp that is turned on/off to indicate if the door is locked or not. The embedded system can also be simulated as another Android application running on another Android device, e.g. an application showing a red/green circle indicating if the smart lock is locked or not.</p><div class="custom-container warning"><p class="custom-container-title">Note</p><p>You will not get any credits for doing things not related to the intended learning outcomes in this course.

For example, the first version of your prototype might note care about runtime configuration changes at all, but when those have been covered in the course, improve your activities by starting to handle them.

For example, one of you might choose to become an expert in how to handle runtime configuration changes, another one might choose to become an expert in how to handle Bluetooth communication, and the third one might choose to become an expert in how to store your data in a database, or how to properly use fragments, etc..</p><p>Sitting three students at one computer and only one writing the code is not efficient and will most likely prevent you from finishing your work on time.</p></div><p>We recommend you to not start too advanced.

To do this in a good way, the Android app could also be responsible for keeping track of which parents that are selling things, and which their unique parent numbers are.</p><h3 id="challenges-opportunities" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#challenges-opportunities" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Challenges / &quot;Opportunities&quot;</h3><h4 id="synchronizing-data" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#synchronizing-data" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Synchronizing data</h4><p>Their usually exists multiple checkouts at the market place, and each checkout will have one device running the Android application. At the end of the day, when computing how much each parent has sold, all data about the selling needs to be accessible from a single device. This means that the data either:</p><ul><li>Needs to be stored at a centralized place, such as a Firestore database. As you understand, it is important that the Android application still can function and register which clothes that has been sold without an Internet connection.</li><li>Needs to be synchronized across multiple devices running the application at the end of the day (Bluetooth?).</li></ul><h4 id="using-the-camera" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#using-the-camera" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Using the camera</h4><p>One possibility is to not only store the name of the parent in the application/Firebase, but also a picture of the parent taken with the camera on the device. This could be useful for the organizers to identify parents.</p><p>Another possibility might be to replace the unique parent numbers with QR codes. This could speed up the checkout process (scanning the QR code with a camera instead of entering the seller number manually). Maybe the price for the clothes could be read by the camera as well somehow?</p><h4 id="using-tags" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#using-tags" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Using Tags</h4><p>Instead of using QR codes, maybe RFID/Bluetooth tags can be used to speed up the checkout process?</p>',17),tt={},ot=(0,o(3744).Z)(tt,[["render",function(e,t){const o=(0,a.up)("CompactInfo"),tt=(0,a.up)("RouterLink"),ot=(0,a.up)("OutboundLink"),at=(0,a.up)("FigureNumber"),nt=(0,a.up)("Figure");return(0,a.wg)(),(0,a.iD)(a.HY,null,[n,r,i,(0,a.Wm)(o,{infoPieces:{"Number of credits":"6",Grades:["Fail","3","4","5"],"How to work":"In groups of three.",Goal:"To learn how to implement an advanced Android application.",Instructions:"Complete the different parts the project work consists of described on this page.
