This can be done by hard-coding a username and a password on the server only you know. When you later login, you send this username and password to the server, which compares them with the username and password that have been hard-coded, and if they match, the server can trust that the request comes from you, because you are the only one who should know the correct username and password. Simple as that!</p><p>However, HTTP is a stateless protocol.

A cookie is a key-value pair the server can send to the client in an HTTP response, and the client should then send this cookie back to the server in future HTTP requests it sends to the server.

Session are built on top of cookies, and consists of key-value pairs stored on the server. Each client gets its own session, and each session has its own unique and hard-to-guess id, known as the <em>session id</em>. The server sends the session id to the client in a cookie when the session for that client is created. The client then sends back the cookie with the session id to the server in its future HTTP requests, and the server can then lookup the information it has stored about that client in the session with the session id it receives in the cookie.</p><p>Use sessions (and cookies) to implement a secure login system for a single account.
