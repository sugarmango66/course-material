The proposals are just brainstormed ideas and need to be researched more to figure out if they are suitable for thesis work or not (such as checking wether someone has done something similar already). The tools required to carry out the thesis are not available.</p><h2 id="laser-pointer-snake" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#laser-pointer-snake" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Laser Pointer Snake</h2><p>Use a 2*2 m² area on a wall as a board for a multiplayer snake game. Point laser pointers (one color for each player) on the screen to instruct the snakes in which direction to move (towards the pointer). Record the board with a camera to find out directions. Use a projector to show how the snakes have moved. Other games can be implemented too, the main idea is to use laser pointers as controllers, catch where they point using a camera, and then visualize the game using a projector.</p><p>Required tools:</p><ul><li>Laser pointers in different colors</li><li>Camera to record the board (e.g. smartphone)</li><li>Projector to visualize game (or TV screen?

Aliens are slowly moved down, and the player should throw a tennis ball/kick a football to hit and destroy the aliens before the reach the ground.

Can the sensors on a smartphone alone provide enough information to navigate you from Point A to Point B, given that you start at Point A, and that the sensor data for the roads has been gathered from before?
