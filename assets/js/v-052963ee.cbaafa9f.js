class="header-anchor" href="#switching-versions" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Switching versions</h3><p>To view a specific version of the project, you simply tell Git <em>Show me the files as they looked like in commit <code>XXX</code></em>, where <code>XXX</code> is the unique identifier for the commit. When you do this, Git will change the files and folders in the project folder so they look precisely the way they did in commit <code>XXX</code>. The command used for this is <code>git reset XXX</code>. It is easy as that to jump between different versions of your source code! However, you better first learn about the HEAD pointer in Git before you create new commits after you have run this command.</p><div class="custom-container warning"><p class="custom-container-title">Note</p><p>You can&#39;t use the command <code>git reset XXX</code> if you have made changes to the source files you haven&#39;t committed yet (because then those changes would be lost).</p></div><h3 id="the-head-pointer" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-head-pointer" aria-hidden="true">#</a> The HEAD pointer</h3><p>In Git, each repository also contains a pointer called HEAD. It points to the branch you are currently working on, but since we avoid introducing branches in this lecture, you can for now see it as that the HEAD pointer points to the last commit you&#39;ve created/the commit you are currently working on. That&#39;s how Git knows which the &quot;previous commit&quot; should be when you create a new commit: it simply uses the commit the HEAD pointer points to as the previous commit, and then when you create a new commit it changes the HEAD pointer to point to the newly created commit.</p><div class="custom-container tip"><p class="custom-container-title">Example</p><p>If you have created two commits, it would look like this:</p><div class="language-text ext-text line-numbers-mode"><pre class="language-text"><code>                        HEAD\n                          ↓\nCommit 1      &lt;--      Commit 2\n</code></pre><div class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span><br><span class="line-number">2</span><br><span class="line-number">3</span><br></div></div><p>If you then create a third commit, it will look like this:</p><div class="language-text ext-text line-numbers-mode"><pre class="language-text"><code>                                               HEAD\n                                                 ↓\nCommit 1      &lt;--      Commit 2      &lt;--      Commit 3\n</code></pre><div class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span><br><span class="line-number">2</span><br><span class="line-number">3</span><br></div></div><p>When you use the command <code>git reset XXX</code>, Git will change the files in your project folder to look the way they did in commit <code>XXX</code>, but it will not change the HEAD pointer to point to commit <code>XXX</code>.

It is not recommended to create branches this way, because you can forget commits (<code>git log</code> only displays the chain of commits the HEAD pointer points to, so you need to remember the other commits not part of this chain yourself (<code>Commit 3</code> in the example above)). So don&#39;t create branches this way; Git has better support for working with branches through various commands which we will cover in next lecture. But this serve as a good example of how you should think of commits and the HEAD pointer.</p><h2 id="when-to-commit" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#when-to-commit" aria-hidden="true">#</a> When to commit</h2><p>A good question is <em>How do I know when it is time to create a new commit?</em> Is it good practice to create a new commit each day? Or should you create commits more often than that? Or less? Or is it the size of the commit (how many lines of you code you have removed/added/modified since the previous commit) that determines when to create a new commit? Are changes including 200 lines of code a good size of a commit? Well, it turns out that the best practice has nothing to do with these properties.</p><p>A good commit should contain a single new feature you have added to the project, or a bug that you have fixed, or similar. This way, it makes more sense to browse through the log of all commits afterwards. If it takes you 1 hour or 10 days to implement the feature/fix the bug, or if it requires changes to 20 lines of code or 2000 lines of code doesn&#39;t matter, although it is good to avoid commits with too big changes. If the feature you should implement is quite big, try to break it down into more smaller features, e.g. instead of implementing the feature <em>Manage blogposts</em> on a website, break it down into these features:</p><ul><li>Create blog posts</li><li>Read blog posts</li><li>Update blog posts</li><li>Delete blog posts</li></ul><p>This way, you end up with 4 smaller commits, instead of one large commit.</p><p>The best way to make use of a version control system is to work in a very structured way. Always before you start to write/change code in the project, you must have a goal that you want to achieve (the feature to implement or the bug to fix), and when this goal has been achieved, it is time to create a new commit.</p><div class="custom-container tip"><p class="custom-container-title">Example</p><p>If the project is about writing a book, then it could be suitable to create a new commit each time you&#39;re done writing a chapter in the book. If spelling mistakes later are discovered, or if you want to improve a chapter by rephrasing sentences or paragraphs, then it could be suitable to create a new commit after each correction/rephrasing.</p></div><div class="custom-container tip"><p class="custom-container-title">Example</p><p>If the project is about creating a website, then it could be suitable to create a new commit each time you have implemented a new webpage on the website. If you later discover a bug or want to improve a webpage, you create a new commit when you have fixed the bug/improved that webpage.</p></div><div class="custom-container tip"><p class="custom-container-title">Example</p><p>If the project is about completing some lab assignments, then it could be suitable to create a new commit each time you have completed one of the assignments and each time you have fixed a mistake in an assignment you thought you had previously completed but now have corrected.</p></div><h2 id="using-git-through-a-gui" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#using-git-through-a-gui" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Using Git through a GUI</h2><p>There exist applications with graphical user interfaces you can use to manage your Git repositories. This includes many IDE:s you can use to write source code. By using such an application, you don&#39;t need to remember all the details about the Git commands (arguments and flags), so this can be an easier way for you to get started with Git. However, these applications use the Git commands under the hood for you, so it is still good have a basic understanding of how the different Git commands work, because your workflow when using Git (creating commits, etc.) is the same no matter if you use it through a graphical user interface or a command line interface.</p><h2 id="practising" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#practising" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Practising</h2>',21),fe=(0,s.Uk)("Play around with "),we={href:"http://git-school.github.io/visualizing-git/#free",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},ye=(0,s.Uk)("Visualizing Git"),ve=(0,s.Uk)(" to learn how commits work.
