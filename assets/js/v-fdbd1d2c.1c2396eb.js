After all, you have been employed for the specific skills you possess, and your employer wants you to make use of them. But in the long run, repeatedly doing the same thing over and over again can be quite boring, causing you to lose concentration and start making mistakes, which in turn makes you unproductive and lowers the quality of your work.</p><p>A computer is an excellent tool to save you from this. Once programmed, it will not only carry out the tasks for you, but it will do so without complaining, much faster than you can, and with the confidence that the task has been carried out correctly, since computers do not make mistakes.</p><p>Unfortunately, computers do not operate/think the same way as we humans do, so programming them can be quite tricky. In this course, you will get familiar with how computers work and how to program them using a programming language called <em>Python</em>. We will start with the very basics, and at the end of the course, you will be able to program computers on your own.</p><h3 id="pre-requisites" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#pre-requisites" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Pre-requisites</h3><p>This course does not have any special pre-requisites other than basic math and English.</p><h2 id="teachers" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#teachers" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Teachers</h2><h3 id="peter-larsson-green" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#peter-larsson-green" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Peter Larsson-Green</h3>',8),o=(0,a._)("h3",{id:"adyasha-swain",tabindex:"-1"},[(0,a._)("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#adyasha-swain","aria-hidden":"true"},"#"),(0,a.Uk)(" Adyasha Swain")],-1),s=(0,a._)("h2",{id:"intended-learning-outcomes",tabindex:"-1"},[(0,a._)("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#intended-learning-outcomes","aria-hidden":"true"},"#"),(0,a.Uk)(" Intended Learning Outcomes")],-1),l=(0,a.Uk)("The intended learning outcomes of the course are found in "),h=(0,a.Uk)("the course syllabus"),u=(0,a.Uk)(" in force.
