We have cookies because HTTP is a stateless protocol. What that means in practice is that when the server receives an HTTP request from a client, that HTTP request should contain all information the server needs to carry out the request. The server should not need to have any memory of previous HTTP requests it has received and carried out. An example of this is shown in "),d=(0,s.Uk)(" below."),u=(0,s.uE)('<p>If the server would remember previous requests, then HTTP wouldn&#39;t be a stateless protocol. So when a server has carried out an HTTP request, it can simply forget everything about that request and the client the request came from.</p><p>So, why is HTTP a stateless protocol? There are some benefits with being stateless. For one, it is much easier to implement the server, because each incoming HTTP request contains all information it needs to carry out the request; no need to look at previous requests or to remember the incoming request for the future. Another benefit is that it is also easier to scale the server if clients communicate with it using a stateless protocol, but let&#39;s not get into the details about that here.</p><p>So, why did we have cookies again? Imagine users can create accounts and login on our website. When a user sends a login request (username and password) to the server, then the server needs to check if these credentials are correct, and if they are, the user should be logged in to that account. When the user in the future sends a new request to the server, the server needs to remember which account that user is logged in to. Since HTTP is a stateless protocol, the server can&#39;t remember such information using HTTP. For this, and many other use-cases where the server need to remember some information about a specific client, we use cookies.</p><h2 id="what-is-a-cookie" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-a-cookie" aria-hidden="true">#</a> What is a cookie?</h2><p>A cookie is simply a key-value pair, where the key is a short description of the value.
