But with Docker, each application the solution consists of will run in it's own container together will all dependencies required to run it, and Docker also provides convenient methods for these applications to communicate with each other, so getting a Dockerized solution up and running on your own computer is a piece of cake once you have downloaded and installed Docker.",-1),i={class:"custom-container danger"},l=(0,n._)("p",{class:"custom-container-title"},"Use Docker Desktop for Windows!",-1),s=(0,n._)("p",null,[(0,n.Uk)("When this lecture was recorded, there was a legacy version of Docker called "),(0,n._)("em",null,"Docker Toolbox"),(0,n.Uk)(", and a newer version of Docker called "),(0,n._)("em",null,"Docker Desktop for Windows"),(0,n.Uk)(".
