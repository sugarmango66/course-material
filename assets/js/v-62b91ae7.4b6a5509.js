If you don&#39;t get them, deal with it in a good way.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Runtime configuration changes</td><td> Handle runtime configuration changes in a good way throughout the entire application, such as: <ul><li>HTTP requests are not re-sent.</li><li>Bluetooth connections are maintained.</li><li>Results of long running operations are cached.</li></ul> Use model fragments, ViewModels, or whatever you prefer. </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Widget</td><td>Create a widget the user can use from the launcher. Too simple widgets (such as only &quot;click on the widget to start an activity&quot;) are not accepted.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Foreground service</td><td>Make use of a foreground service in a suitable way (important background computations, geofences, Bluetooth connections, etc.).</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Re-using fragments</td><td>Re-use none-elementary fragments you have created, such as one fragment showing a list of items, another one showing a single item, and then show one fragment at a time on a small screen and show both side-by-side on a large screen.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Third-party authentication</td><td>Let users login with their account from another company, such as Google or Facebook. This is of course in addition to ordinary login with username and password, or similar.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Loading indicators</td><td>When the application starts a long running operation/waits for something, show a loading indicator of some kind reflecting this. Remove the loading indicator afterwards.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Alarm Scheduling</td><td>Schedule alarms/jobs that notifies the user at certain times, for example 15 minutes before a meeting starts. If the meeting is cancelled or the time for the meeting is changed, the scheduled alarms of course need to be deleted or updated too. Structure your solution well, so there&#39;s no need to copy-paste similar code if you for example want to create new meetings at multiple different places in your application.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Push Notifications</td><td>Automatically send a push notification to a user&#39;s device (for example using <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging" target="_blank">Firebase Cloud Messaging</a>) when there is something the user needs to be notified about ASAP, such as new event created nearby, new message sent to the user, an event the user has signed up for is cancelled, etc.).<br><br><b>Note:</b> Push Notifications are not the same thing as ordinary <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/notifiers/notifications">Notifications</a> in Android; Push Notifications are &quot;pushed&quot; to the device from a server.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Different type of accounts</td><td>Support different type of accounts, such as guest accounts, ordinary accounts, admin accounts, etc. Users should be able to do different things in the app depending on what type of account they are signed in to. For example, an ordinary user might only be able to create data belonging to her own account, while an admin can create data belonging to another account (acting as if she is signed in to another account).<br><br><b>Note:</b> Simply hiding/showing a few GUI components depending on the account type (such as admin accounts have a link to an admin activity ordinary users can&#39;t access) is not enough.</td></tr><tr><td>0.5</td><td>Creating QR Codes</td><td>The app can create different QR codes that can be used by the app itself or another app.</td></tr><tr><td>0.5</td><td>Reading QR Codes</td><td>The app uses the camera on the Android device (either directly or indirectly) to read and react to QR codes.</td></tr><tr><td>?</td><td>Own suggestions</td><td>Come up with your own suggestions of extra functionality.
