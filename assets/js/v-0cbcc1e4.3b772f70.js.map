The proposals are just brainstormed ideas and need to be researched more to figure out if they are suitable for thesis work or not (such as checking wether someone has done something similar already).

Point laser pointers (one color for each player) on the screen to instruct the snakes in which direction to move (towards the pointer). Record the board with a camera to find out directions. Use a projector to show how the snakes have moved. Other games can be implemented too, the main idea is to use laser pointers as controllers, catch where they point using a camera, and then visualize the game using a projector.</p>\n<p>Required tools:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Laser pointers in different colors</li>\n<li>Camera to record the board (e.g. smartphone)</li>\n<li>Projector to visualize game (or TV screen?

Can the sensors on a smartphone alone provide enough information to navigate you from Point A to Point B, given that you start at Point A, and that the sensor data for the roads has been gathered from before? The thesis is about investigating if sensors on a smartphone (magnetometer, accelerometer, etc.) can be used to navigate you from Point A to Point B.</p>\n<p>Required tools:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A smartphone</li>\n<li>A vehicle (car, bike, etc.) for testing (walking/running might work)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Potential research questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>While travelling on a road, will the sensor data from smartphones vary enough from different parts of the road to recognize the same pattern when travelling there again?</li>\n<li>Are sensor readings from smartphones while travelling on roads unique enough so sensor readings from a ~30 second ride on a road can identify which road the user is travelling on?</li>\n</ul>\n","import { render } from \"./index.html.vue?vue&type=template&id=85ffcbdc\"\nconst script = {}\n\nimport exportComponent from \"C:\\\\Users\\\\peter\\\\projects\\\\course-material\\\\node_modules\\\\vue-loader\\\\dist\\\\exportHelper.js\"\nconst __exports__ = /*#__PURE__*/exportComponent(script, [['render',render]])\n\nexport default __exports__","\"use strict\";\nObject.defineProperty(exports, \"__esModule\", { value: true });\n// runtime helper for setting properties on components\n// in a tree-shakable way\nexports.default = (sfc, props) => {\n    const target = sfc.__vccOpts || sfc;\n    for (const [key, val] of props) {\n        target[key] = val;\n    }\n    return target;\n};\n","export const data = {\n  \"key\": \"v-0cbcc1e4\",\n  \"path\": \"/lectures/thesis-proposals/\",\n  \"title\": \"Thesis Proposals\",\n  \"lang\": \"en-US\",\n  \"frontmatter\": {\n    \"sidebar\": \"auto\",\n    \"navbarTitle\": \"Thesis Proposals\"\n  },\n  \"excerpt\": \"\",\n  \"headers\": [\n    {\n      \"level\": 2,\n      \"title\": \"Laser Pointer Snake\",\n      \"slug\": \"laser-pointer-snake\",\n      \"children\": []\n    },\n    {\n      \"level\": 2,\n      \"title\": \"Real ~Space Invaders\",\n      \"slug\": \"real-space-invaders\",\n      \"children\": []\n    },\n    {\n      \"level\": 2,\n      \"title\": \"Predict Chanterelles Location\",\n      \"slug\": \"predict-chanterelles-location\",\n      \"children\": []\n    },\n    {\n      \"level\": 2,\n      \"title\": \"Navigating Roads without GPS Receivers\",\n      \"slug\": \"navigating-roads-without-gps-receivers\",\n      \"children\": []\n    }\n  ],\n  \"filePathRelative\": \"lectures/thesis-proposals/README.md\",\n  \"git\": {\n    \"updatedTime\": 1613553146000\n  }\n}\n"],"names":["script","exports","sfc","props","target","__vccOpts","key","val","data"],"sourceRoot":""}
