It indicates what the client wants to do with the resource identified by the <code>URI</code> (the second part). For example, the <code>GET</code> method indicates that the client wants to retrieve the resource, so the server should send back the resource in an HTTP response. The <code>DELETE</code> method indicates that the client wants the server to delete the resource, so the server should delete the resource before it sends back the HTTP response.</p><p>The third part on the request line, <code>VERSION</code>, indicates which version of HTTP the client is using, so the server can use the same version. A common value used here is <code>HTTP/1.1</code>, but HTTP 2 is used more and more frequently these days, so seeing <code>HTTP/2</code> is also common these days. HTTP 2 is backward compatible with HTTP 1.1, so even if you are only taught the basics of HTTP 1.1 in this lecture, you have use of that if you want to learn HTTP 2 later (HTTP 2 primarily contains additional functionality for loading webpages faster).</p><p>Below the request line you find <em>the headers</em>. These are key-value pairs with additional information about the request. For example, the <code>Host</code> header is used to indicate the domain name or the IP address of the server the request should be sent to (for example <code>Host: ju.se</code>), and the <code>Accept</code> header is used to indicate which data format the client would like to get back the requested resource in (for example <code>Accept: text/html</code>).</p><p>Below the headers you find the <code>BODY</code> of the request. Here the client can pass a resource to the server in the HTTP request. This is used when the client wants to create a new resource on the server or update an existing resource.

These aren&#39;t that important to know for programmers using HTTP, so they won&#39;t be described in detail here.</p><h4 id="_2xx" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2xx" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 2XX</h4><p>The <code>2XX</code> status codes indicate that the server successfully carried out the HTTP request. The most commonly used ones are (reason phrase shown after the status code):</p><ul><li><code>200</code> OK<br> The server carried out the request and sends back a resource in the body of the response</li><li><code>201</code> Created<br> The server carried out the request and a new resource was created while carrying out the request. The <code>Location</code> header in the HTTP response contains the URI for the newly created resource</li><li><code>204</code> No Content<br> The server carried out the request, but the response contains no body (can for example be used in <code>DELETE</code> requests)</li></ul><h4 id="_3xx" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_3xx" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 3XX</h4><p>The <code>3XX</code> status codes indicate that the server encourages the client to send a new HTTP request using another URI instead (i.e. redirecting the client). Examples include:</p><ul><li><code>302</code> Found<br> The server encourages the client to send the same HTTP request again but with the URI specified in the <code>Location</code> response header instead. This is useful if you change URIs on a website. For example, first maybe <code>/about-us</code> was used to identify the about page on the website, and then you changed that to just <code>/about</code>. Then when a client sends a <code>GET</code> request to <code>/about-us</code> you can send back a <code>302</code> response with the header <code>Location: /about</code> to indicate that the URI for the page has changed to <code>/about</code>, and that the client should use this new URI instead</li></ul><h4 id="_4xx" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_4xx" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 4XX</h4><p>The <code>4XX</code> status codes indicate that the server didn&#39;t carry out the request because the client has done something wrong with the request. The client needs to fix the problem and try again. Examples include:</p><ul><li><code>400</code> Bad Request<br> The server didn&#39;t carry out the request because something is wrong with it. The body of the response can contain additional information about what&#39;s wrong. Better to use another <code>4XX</code> status code if a more specific code that describes the problem exists</li><li><code>401</code> Unauthorized<br> The server didn&#39;t carry out the request because the client is not authorized to request it (the client might for example need to login first)</li><li><code>404</code> Not Found<br> The server didn&#39;t carry out the request because the URI in the request doesn&#39;t identify a resource that exists</li></ul><h4 id="_5xx" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_5xx" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 5XX</h4><p>The <code>5XX</code> status codes indicate that the server couldn&#39;t carry out the request because something is wrong on the server-side. Maybe the server crashed, or maybe the server needs to access an external component (such as a database) to carry out the request, but it couldn&#39;t access it the moment, etc. Examples include:</p><ul><li><code>500 </code> Internal Server Error<br> The server couldn&#39;t carry out the request</li></ul><h2 id="world-wide-web" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#world-wide-web" aria-hidden="true">#</a> World Wide Web</h2>',20),ke=(0,a.Uk)("So, why is it called "),ve=(0,a._)("em",null,"the world wide web",-1),ye=(0,a.Uk)("?
