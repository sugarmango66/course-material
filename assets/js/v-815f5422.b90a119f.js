The platform may be about whatever you want, but the following requirements exist:</p><ul><li>Users should be able to create accounts.</li><li>Users should be able to login to accounts.</li><li>Users should be able to create at least one other type of resource (in addition to accounts) that belongs to an account.</li></ul><p>Example of the additional resource type could be:</p><ul><li>Blogposts for a platform hosting blogs.</li><li>Diary entries for platforms hosting diaries.</li><li>Movies for a platform where users can register movies they&#39;ve watched.</li></ul><p>If you want to have a more fun platform to implement, you probably need to have accounts + 2-3 additional resource types, but it is OK to just have one additional resource type.</p><p>Try to be creative and come up with an idea that solves a real world problem. For example, <em>standing in line and wait</em> is boring, maybe you can come up with a platform that somehow makes it fun? Or maybe a platform that entirely eliminates the need to stand in line and wait? Or maybe you know someone (football coach, friend at a company, etc.) that have some problem you can help them with by creating a platform (such as keeping track of which players attended which practice sessions, or who&#39;s responsible to bring fika to work each friday, etc.).</p><p>Users should be able to apply <abbr title="Create, Read, Update, Delete">CRUD</abbr> operations on at least accounts + 1 additional resource type on the platform, but how they do that through the frontend is up to you to decide. For example, to delete an account you may have a delete button either on the <em>View account</em> &quot;page&quot; or you may have a dedicated <em>Delete account</em> &quot;page&quot; that only contains the delete button. Users should also be able to login to the account they have created using a username and a password.</p><p>Describe your platform as detailed as possible in your project report.
