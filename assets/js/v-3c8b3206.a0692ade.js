I would rather say they constitute one third of the learning material, the other two thirds being the recommended reading in the course book and the tutorials, and now I&#39;m not even counting the exercises and the labs, which are also intended to help you learn.</p><p>When I gave the course for the first time, I did have lectures on campus instead of recorded videos. My experiences from those lectures are that many students had difficulties keeping up at the lectures, especially the ones who find programming very hard, giving them a hard time understanding most after the first part of the lecture. Therefor I think recorded lectures is the better alternative, so everybody can learn the basics at their own pace.</p><p>I recognize that learning (and remembering) something is harder from videos, and easier when &quot;interacting&quot; more during the learning process. That&#39;s why much of the learning in the course is hands-on, with exercises being quite central. After you have been introduced to the basics through the recorded lectures and the recommended learning, try to do the exercises, which will give you more in-depth insights. And after that we have the tutorials, which can give you even more in-depth insights. And then apply it in the labs, which might give you some even more additional insights.</p><p>In short, instead of having long lectures followed by a long session for students to write code on, I find it better with many more shorter &quot;lectures&quot; followed by shorter sessions for students to write code on.</p><h2 id="possibility-to-achieve-the-intended-learning-outcomes-through-lectures-laborations-seminars-projects-assignments-literature-other-teaching-aids" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#possibility-to-achieve-the-intended-learning-outcomes-through-lectures-laborations-seminars-projects-assignments-literature-other-teaching-aids" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Possibility to achieve the intended learning outcomes (through lectures, laborations, seminars, projects, assignments, literature, other teaching aids).</h2><blockquote><p>Programming is a practical practice, which means that a &quot;hands-on&quot; approach is the best suitable for learning. This is exactly what we received through the laborations.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>When told on the introduction that if we manage to complete the labs, we will without trouble pass the exam, and that no additional studying should be required. This wasn&#39;t near the truth and several students failed the exam because of this.<br> The fact that a test exam was published but without any answers wasn&#39;t very much of help either as one couldn&#39;t know if one had understood the question or not. During the exam we were suppose to compile code but without any resources of testing the code, giving no chance to know if it will work as intended or not. During one of the first lecture it was mentioned that nobody writes code without any program to run the code in, which makes the entire exam contradictive and the information from the teacher misleading.</p></blockquote><p>I still insist on that if you manage to write and understand how the code you have written works for all the problems in the lab you should without difficulties manage to pass the written exam (get at least 12 points out of 30 in total). Most of the questions on the written exam test the very same thing as has been covered in the labs.</p><p>Sample answers to the questions on the sample exam were shown at one of the last tutorials in the course. In addition to this, asking for help (including how to think about questions on the exam) is also allowed during the course.</p><p>It is true that you can&#39;t compile and test run your code at the written exam (that&#39;s on purpose), and it might be true that I have said at the first lecture that programmers never write code without running it (I don&#39;t remember), but the written exam is not about testing how good professional programmers you are (that&#39;s rather what the labs are for), but to test your understanding of the basics in programming. That includes you knowing the syntax in Python and being able to execute the code and spot errors on your own.</p><h2 id="this-worked-really-well-in-the-course" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#this-worked-really-well-in-the-course" aria-hidden="true">#</a> This worked really well in the course</h2><blockquote><p>I&#39;m very happy with the lab assistant sessions which were of big help to challenge our understanding of different concepts. Great feedback and nice interactions with the lab assistant as well. Clear and thoughtful lectures from Peter - I especially appreciate how thoroughly he explained examples which made it easier to remember and understand important steps of writing code. One of the best courses of my programme so far!</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Very clear study guide with just enough information provided to figure out the challenges.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>The layout of the course was good. I liked the freedom in being able to sit at home and code for the exercises/labs at your own pace and whenever you want to and the come to lab session to show your work. The pre-recorded lectures where very good as you could watch them at your own pace and re-watch bits whenever necessary. They were also very informative and I felt like most of what was needed for the labs/exercises could be found in the videos (of course some googling was necessary for some assignments though).</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>The laborations were great to put our newly learned skills into practice, learning along the way. <br><br> Having live tutorials on how to solve certain problems, whilst at the same time having access to lectures online was really helpful.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Most of students fail the final exam. I THINK its not fair to correct the paper of bim students same as IT student. We never had experience in this course and I think we barely use programing in this major. So please organize for next time score the exam in a better way. Thank</p></blockquote><p>The course has been designed for students with no previous experience of programming. Some students from the IT program might have some experience from before that are beneficial for them in this course, but that does not make the course harder for the students without those experiences, but instead rather easier for the students that has them.</p><p>No matter which earlier experiences students possess, I must treat them all the same way.</p><hr><blockquote><p>Labs, lectures, exercises, course literature, learning platform</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Having the course material uploaded as videos, makes them quite accessible at any time and is beneficial to students. the Lab teacher&#39;s knowledge on program solving was impressive and her advises were wise and helpful. the flexible lab sessions and extra hours put into checking students lab works really helped with ones who had problems with programming and helped with learning at our own&#39;s pace.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Very good communication and structure in the course, everything was well provided and described.</p></blockquote><h2 id="the-course-has-room-for-improvement-in-the-following-areas" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-course-has-room-for-improvement-in-the-following-areas" aria-hidden="true">#</a> The course has room for improvement in the following areas</h2><blockquote><p>Can&#39;t think of any</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Implement a queue system in the lab presentation sessions to make it more effective. Hours were spent just waiting.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>The first few weeks it was very crowded in the lab when everyone wanted to have their labs graded, so that a lot of people had to sit patiently and wait for hours until they could get their time with the teacher. It got better over time as less people started showing up to the sessions (maybe they fell behind schedule, I&#39;m not sure). If there could be any chance to have an extra lab assistant at the sessions that would probably be appreciated by many.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>During some lab sessions, it could take quite some time before we got to present the labs. Of course, it is good that the teacher/lab assistant spends time with the student presenting the labs. However, I feel that it could be helpful to have two teachers/lab assistants present during the lab session to speed up the process.</p></blockquote><p>I was never told during the course that long waiting times to present at the lab sessions was a problem, but if I were, I might have been able to do something about it. Optimally there would of course be no waiting time at all, but is it really a big problem? Can&#39;t you work on something else while waiting? Most likely there are exercises/other lab problems in this course you can work on while waiting for your turn, or in worst case work on something in the other course you are taking at the same time (this course is a half speed course).</p><p>But we might be able to improve this for next year, for example start all lab sessions with two teachers, and then one teacher leaves when the presentation queue has been eliminated the first time.</p><hr><blockquote><p>Would be great to actually be able to use programming software for the exam where we can run our code. The exam that we actually had required the code to be flawless first try which is unrealistic and not at all relevant to coding. When you actually write code you are able to see what is wrong, run debuggers and solve the problems in your code.<br><br> Also would be nice if we weren&#39;t told that we would pass the exam easily if we did the laborations, only for the exam to not be at all what the laborations were.</p></blockquote><p>No, the code you wrote as answer did not had to be flawless. It only had to be flawless (or very close to flawless) to get full score on the question. Answers that was close to functional did not get 0 points, but instead full score with point reduction for the flaws it contained.</p><p>I agree that it is unrealistic for most beginners to get the code 100% functional on first try. That&#39;s why you get point reductions instead of 0 points, and only 80% of max score is required to get grade 5, so you can get grade 5 even if your code contains some flaws.</p><p>I understand that writing a 100% correct answer to the code questions on the exam would be easier for you by being able to test run your code. But then I won&#39;t be able to examine if you understand how the code execution works. I think that&#39;s a very important part to examine, and therefor prefers to give point reductions to the students whose code contains flaws. Furthermore, if you would be able to test run your code, in which case I wouldn&#39;t be able to examine your understanding of how the execution works, I would have to punish other type of errors (such as bad variable name) more, and then I imagine students would complain about unrealistic harsh punishment for those type of errors ^^&#39;</p><p>I&#39;ll probably stick with not allowing the computer to execute code on the written exam.</p><p>Even if parts of the exam has different type of questions than the labs (which are only about writing code), you should have learned most of what you need to know for the exam by completing the labs. Further more, by looking at the sample exam, the questions you got on your exam can&#39;t have come as a big surprise.</p><hr><blockquote><p>When told on the introduction that if we manage to complete the labs, we will without trouble pass the exam, and that no additional studying should be required. This wasn&#39;t near the truth and several students failed the exam because of this. <br> The fact that a test exam was published but without any answers wasn&#39;t very much of help either as one couldn&#39;t know if one had understood the question or not.

During one of the first lecture it was mentioned that nobody writes code without any program to run the code in, which makes the entire exam contradictive and the information from the teacher misleading.</p></blockquote><p>See my previous comments.</p><hr><blockquote><p>I don&#39;t like the exam format as coding is a lot about trial and error to me. Just coding in a text box made it easy to make mistakes</p></blockquote><p>IMO, trial and error is an excellent way of learning programming in the beginning. But the written exam is not for learning, but to show what you can, and using trial and error is not expected here.</p><hr><blockquote><p>Programming course is a rather complex subject and students come from a variety of programming backgrounds. therefore a programming mindset is needed for successful problem solving. the course material and teaching was mainly focused on learning different functions rather than teaching students how to break problems into simple steps and think like a programmer. many functions which were introduced seemed redundant and unnecessary, so perhaps instead of accumulating function information into a quarter of semester, maybe it would be more beneficial to put focus on fundamental subjects and show their use potential in various ways to have students master the basic knowledge and improve in thinking outside the box and develop better skills in programming</p></blockquote><p>There are different approaches to teaching programming, and some students will always prefer one approach over others. No matter which approach that is used in the course, there will always be some students that are not happy with the chosen approach.</p><p>I know many of the students taking the course find programming quite hard. That&#39;s why I&#39;ve chosen to often use &quot;small&quot; (and consequently often &quot;redundant&quot;) problems and functions in the course, to make it easier. The trade off here is that students might find programming less useful and interesting.</p><p>Another approach is to use &quot;big&quot; problems (and consequently more &quot;lifelike&quot;), which will make the programming more relevant and more interesting for the students, but at the cost of being harder to solve.</p><p>There are simply different approaches, and as far as I know there&#39;s no &quot;one size fit all&quot;.</p><hr><blockquote><p>I think the grading criteria for the examination is quite tough for students who have never worked with programing before. To many ways of getting minus points.</p></blockquote><p>I think the number of errors a student make should be reflected in the grade, instead of being ignored. If I start to only grade answers correct/incorrect, many answers close to correct answer would then be graded as an incorrect answer and rewarded 0 points, and I don&#39;t think students would appreciate that.</p>',66),r={},n=(0,o(3744).Z)(r,[["render",function(e,t){return a}]])},3744:(e,t)=>{t.Z=(e,t)=>{const o=e.__vccOpts||e;for(const[e,a]of t)o[e]=a;return o}},2120:(e,t,o)=>{o.r(t),o.d(t,{data:()=>a});const a={key:"v-3c8b3206",path:"/courses/introduction-to-script-programming/feedback-2021.html",title:"Feedback 2021",lang:"en-US",frontmatter:{},excerpt:"",headers:[{level:2,title:"My opinion about the course material (e.g. course literature, scientific literature, recorded lectures, web quizes, instructions for laborations)",slug:"my-opinion-about-the-course-material-e-g-course-literature-scientific-literature-recorded-lectures-web-quizes-instructions-for-laborations",children:[]},{level:2,title:"Possibility to achieve the intended learning outcomes (through lectures, laborations, seminars, projects, assignments, literature, other teaching aids).",slug:"possibility-to-achieve-the-intended-learning-outcomes-through-lectures-laborations-seminars-projects-assignments-literature-other-teaching-aids",children:[]},{level:2,title:"This worked really well in the course",slug:"this-worked-really-well-in-the-course",children:[]},{level:2,title:"The course has room for improvement in the following areas",slug:"the-course-has-room-for-improvement-in-the-following-areas",children:[]}],filePathRelative:"courses/introduction-to-script-programming/feedback-2021.md",git:{updatedTime:1652182029e3}}}}]);
