This is the case when the repository does not consists of a single chain of commits. An example of that would be a repository consisting of the following commits:</p><div class="language-text ext-text line-numbers-mode"><pre class="language-text"><code>                       Commit 4                HEAD\n                          ↓                      ↓ \nCommit 1      &lt;--      Commit 2      &lt;--      Commit 3\n</code></pre><div class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span><br><span class="line-number">2</span><br><span class="line-number">3</span><br></div></div><p>Here we can see that we have two different latest versions of the project represented by <code>Commit 4</code> and <code>Commit 3</code> respectively. They both contain features/functionalities the other version does not contain, and we say that we have two branches of the project at <code>Commit 2</code>. To know which version of the project we are working on, Git uses the <code>HEAD</code> pointer, so in this case we can see that we are currently working on the branch with <code>Commit 3</code> (if we would create a new commit, that commit would point to <code>Commit 3</code>).</p><p>So, a <em>branch</em> is simply a separate line of commits that takes the project in a different direction.</p><p>By default, there exists a single branch called <code>master</code>, which usually is used for the &quot;main version&quot; of the project. As long as you don&#39;t create a new branch and switch to it, you always work on the <code>master</code> branch.</p><p>In practice, a branch is just a pointer that points to the latest commit in that branch.

But why would you want that? In the end, you only want to have a single version of the project that contains all the features/functionalities, and not 5 different versions that each contains a fifth of all the functionalities, right?</p><p>When you have two branches, you can merge the work you have done (the commits) in one of them into the other. You do that by creating a special type of commit called a <em>merge commit</em>. A merge commit is a new commit that points to the latest commit in each of the two branches, so this new commit will contain the features/functionality from both branches.</p><p>When you have created a merge commit, the commits in a repository can look like this:</p><div class="language-text ext-text line-numbers-mode"><pre class="language-text"><code>                                               HEAD\n                                                 ↓\n                                           MASTER BRANCH\n                                                 ↓\n                       Commit 4      &lt;--      Commit 5\n                          ↓                      ↓ \nCommit 1      &lt;--      Commit 2      &lt;--      Commit 3\n                                                 ↑\n                                             TEST BRANCH\n</code></pre><div class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span><br><span class="line-number">2</span><br><span class="line-number">3</span><br><span class="line-number">4</span><br><span class="line-number">5</span><br><span class="line-number">6</span><br><span class="line-number">7</span><br><span class="line-number">8</span><br><span class="line-number">9</span><br></div></div><p><code>Commit 5</code> will now contain the features/functionality from both <code>Commit 4</code> and <code>Commit 3</code>, and can now be seen as the single latest version of the project.</p><div class="custom-container warning"><p class="custom-container-title">Merging can be hard!</p><p>Creating merge commits can be a little bit complicated; you can have merge conflicts (contradictive changes to the source code in the two different branches)) that you need to handle.

Turns out that branches are really useful during development. Especially when multiple programmers work on the same project at the same time, because a programmer don&#39;t want to be disturbed by commits from other programmers that might interfere with the programmer&#39;s own work before it is finished. So each programmer can create their own branch which the other programmers won&#39;t interfere with, and when the programmer is done with all of her work on that branch, she can share her work with the other programmers by merging it with the <code>master</code> branch. It can for example look like this (let&#39;s ignore the <code>HEAD</code> pointer, because it is not important in this example):</p><div class="language-text ext-text line-numbers-mode"><pre class="language-text"><code>                       Commit 3      &lt;--      Commit 6      &lt;--      ALICE BRANCH\n                          ↓\nCommit 1      &lt;--      Commit 2      &lt;--      MASTER BRANCH\n                          ↑\n                       Commit 4      &lt;--      Commit 5      &lt;--      BOB BRANCH\n</code></pre><div class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span><br><span class="line-number">2</span><br><span class="line-number">3</span><br><span class="line-number">4</span><br><span class="line-number">5</span><br></div></div><p>When Alice is done with her work, she merges her branch with the <code>master</code> branch:</p><div class="language-text ext-text line-numbers-mode"><pre class="language-text"><code>                       Commit 3      &lt;--      Commit 6\n                          ↓                      ↑\nCommit 1      &lt;--      Commit 2      &lt;--      Commit 7      &lt;--      MASTER BRANCH (now also containing Alice&#39;s work)\n                          ↑\n                       Commit 4      &lt;--      Commit 5      &lt;--      BOB BRANCH\n</code></pre><div class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span><br><span class="line-number">2</span><br><span class="line-number">3</span><br><span class="line-number">4</span><br><span class="line-number">5</span><br></div></div><p>And when Bob is done with his work, he merges his work with the <code>master</code> branch:</p><div class="language-text ext-text line-numbers-mode"><pre class="language-text"><code>                       Commit 3      &lt;--      Commit 6\n                          ↓                      ↑\nCommit 1      &lt;--      Commit 2      &lt;--      Commit 7      &lt;--      Commit 8      &lt;--      MASTER BRANCH (now containing both Alice&#39;s work and Bob&#39;s work)\n                          ↑                                             |\n                       Commit 4      &lt;--      Commit 5      &lt;-----------┙\n</code></pre><div class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span><br><span class="line-number">2</span><br><span class="line-number">3</span><br><span class="line-number">4</span><br><span class="line-number">5</span><br></div></div><div class="custom-container warning"><p class="custom-container-title">Note</p><p>How multiple programmers sitting at different computers can work on the same repository (to synch commits) is not something we cover in this lecture, but Git has special support for this which we will cover in next lecture.</p></div><p>There are more use-cases for branches than just &quot;one branch per programmer&quot;. For example, if you create a library, then you might want to have one branch for each major version of the library you have, so you conveniently can switch between them. This way, it is easy to fix bugs/security vulnerabilities in older versions of the library, and to add new features in the latest version of the library. Or maybe you just want to test something new which you don&#39;t know if you&#39;ll have any use of. Then you can do that work in a new branch, and if you later discover that it didn&#39;t play out well, you go back and work as usual on the <code>master</code> branch or your own branch.</p><div class="custom-container tip"><p class="custom-container-title">Example</p><p>A designer was given the task to improve the layout on a website (change the placement of menus, change the colors used, etc.).
