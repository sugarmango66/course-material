The specification <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">HTTP State Management Mechanism<OutboundLink/></a> explains how it works in detail, but let me give you a quick introduction to cookies before you read the specification.</p>\n<h2 id=\"http-is-stateless\" tabindex=\"-1\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#http-is-stateless\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a> HTTP is stateless</h2>\n<p>So, why do we have cookies? We have cookies because HTTP is a stateless protocol. What that means in practice is that when the server receives an HTTP request from a client, that HTTP request should contain all information the server needs to carry out the request. The server should not need to have any memory of previous HTTP requests it has received and carried out. An example of this is shown in <FigureNumber /> below.</p>\n<Figure caption=\"Example of Server having no memory of previous HTTP requests it has received.\">\n<RenderMermaid graph-definition=\"\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Client as Client A\n    participant Server\n    Client->>+Server: 1. HTTP Request: What is 4 + 5?\n    Note right of Server: 2. Carry out request: Compute 4 + 5 = 9\n    Server-->>-Client: 3. HTTP Response: 4 + 5 = 9\n    Client->>+Server: 4. HTTP Request: Which was last request I sent?\n    Note right of Server: 5. Carry out request: Have I received requests before? :S\n    Server-->>-Client: 6. HTTP Response: No idea\n\" />\n</Figure>\n<p>If the server would remember previous requests, then HTTP wouldn't be a stateless protocol. So when a server has carried out an HTTP request, it can simply forget everything about that request and the client the request came from.</p>\n<p>So, why is HTTP a stateless protocol? There are some benefits with being stateless. For one, it is much easier to implement the server, because each incoming HTTP request contains all information it needs to carry out the request; no need to look at previous requests or to remember the incoming request for the future. Another benefit is that it is also easier to scale the server if clients communicate with it using a stateless protocol, but let's not get into the details about that here.</p>\n<p>So, why did we have cookies again? Imagine users can create accounts and login on our website. When a user sends a login request (username and password) to the server, then the server needs to check if these credentials are correct, and if they are, the user should be logged in to that account. When the user in the future sends a new request to the server, the server needs to remember which account that user is logged in to. Since HTTP is a stateless protocol, the server can't remember such information using HTTP. For this, and many other use-cases where the server need to remember some information about a specific client, we use cookies.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-a-cookie\" tabindex=\"-1\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#what-is-a-cookie\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a> What is a cookie?</h2>\n<p>A cookie is simply a key-value pair, where the key is a short description of the value. The key is sometimes also called the name of the cookie.</p>\n<div class=\"custom-container tip\"><p class=\"custom-container-title\">Example</p>\n<p>If the server needs to remember that the user is 17 years old, then it could create a cookie with the key <code>age</code> and the value <code>17</code>.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"custom-container tip\"><p class=\"custom-container-title\">Example</p>\n<p>If the server needs to remember that a user lives in Jönköping, then it could create a cookie with the key <code>city</code> and the value <code>Jönköping</code>.</p>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"what-can-we-use-cookies-for\" tabindex=\"-1\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#what-can-we-use-cookies-for\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a> What can we use cookies for?</h2>\n<p>Cookies are used to remember information about the client/user. What information is up to you to decide, but here are some examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Remember which pages the user has visited on a website</li>\n<li>Remember what the user has searched for on a website</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"basic-usage\" tabindex=\"-1\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#basic-usage\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a> Basic usage</h2>\n<p>So, using cookies, a server can remember information about a client. It works something like this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A client sends an HTTP request to the server</li>\n<li>When the server carries out the request, it realizes that it needs to remember some information about this client</li>\n<li>In the HTTP response the server sends back to the client, it tells the client to create a new cookie containing a specific key and a specific value</li>\n<li>When the client receives the HTTP response, it should create a cookie with the key and value the server instructed it to do in the response</li>\n<li>When the client sends HTTP requests to the server in the future, it should pass along the cookie (the key-value pair) to the server</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This is visualized in <FigureNumber /> below.</p>\n<Figure caption=\"Sequence Diagram visualizing how cookies work.\">\n<RenderMermaid graph-definition=\"\nsequenceDiagram\n\tparticipant Client\n\tparticipant Server\n\tClient->>+Server: HTTP Request\n\tNote right of Server: Need to remember\n\tServer->>-Client: HTTP Response (create cookie)\n\tNote left of Client: Creates and stores cookie\n\tClient->>+Server: HTTP Request (with cookie)\n\tNote right of Server: Reads info from cookie\n\tServer->>-Client: HTTP Response\n\" />\n</Figure>\n<p>So simply put: the server can tell the client to create cookies, the cookies are stored on the client (how is up to the client to decide, but most web browsers simply store them in files), and the client sends the cookies to the server in the HTTP requests it sends to the server.</p>\n<h3 id=\"creating-a-cookie\" tabindex=\"-1\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#creating-a-cookie\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a> Creating a cookie</h3>\n<p>The server can tell a client to create a new cookie by adding the <code>Set-Cookie</code> header in the HTTP response.
