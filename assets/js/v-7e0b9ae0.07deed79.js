In practice that&#39;s usually not possible. The application is often too big for that, and one of the points with dividing the project into tasks is so that each team member can work on her own part of the project without knowing/without having to worry about the details in other parts of the project others are working on.</p><p>To be more productive, one can assign each team member a role, and that team member is then responsible for knowing all there is to know that is associated with that role. For example, one team member might be responsible for designing the graphical user interface and implementing the overall layout of the application (i.e. the role <em>GUI expert</em>), another team member might be responsible for designing the structure of the database and write an API the application can use to communicate with it (i.e. the role <em>Database expert</em>), a third team member might be responsible for learning Bluetooth and write an API the application can use to communicate with other devices using Bluetooth (i.e. the role <em>Bluetooth expert</em>), etc.</p><p>To have a role does not mean only that team member should work on tasks that are associated with that role. For example, the team member who is responsible for the database should not carry out all tasks that involves the database. Instead, this team member should be considered to be the database expert. This team member will probably do most of the work that involves the database (such as designing the structure of the database and to start implement the API one can use to communicate with it), but once the basics for this are done, any other team member should be able to work on tasks that involves making small changes to the database structure or the database API. If in doubt of how to do it, one can discuss the details with the database expert.</p><div class="custom-container tip"><p class="custom-container-title">Give different team members different roles/responsibilities</p><p>We recommend you to assign each team member one or more roles, so you specialize in different parts of the application. In the end, all students must know how all the code works, but it is OK if just one student is an expert and learn all there is to know about a technology, and then teaches the rest of the team members how your application makes use of that technology in best way possible.</p></div><h2 id="learn-first-implement-then" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#learn-first-implement-then" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Learn first, implement then</h2><p>Projects carried out by students are not 100% the same as projects carried out by professionals. If a professional project manager puts together a team of her choice, she&#39;ll probably pick an experienced database manager to work on the database in the project, an experienced web developer to work on the website in the project, an experienced Android developer to work on the Android application in the project, etc. These experienced workers already know the area they are responsible for in the project, so it&#39;s quite straight forward for them to contribute with their parts to the project.</p><p>Students on the other hand are not experienced professionals. Often they don&#39;t know the subject they are responsible for in the project in advance, and first need to learn the subject and then implement the part they are responsible for. This is of course much harder! It might feel a bit unfair, but remember that students have more time to work on their projects than what professionals do, and the reason for this is of course so that students can learn the subject at the same time, so it&#39;s not as bad as it first might seem.</p><div class="custom-container warning"><p class="custom-container-title">It&#39;s hard to be a professional too!</p><p>Sometimes professionals need to learn the subject as they work on the project too. It&#39;s not uncommon that one person suddenly stops working on a project at a company (maybe that person got sick, got a new job, or maybe got hit by a car and unexpectedly died), and it&#39;s not uncommon that the boss then re-assigns that person&#39;s duties to other workers at the company, even though if it&#39;s not their area of expertise (they need someone working on it, and hiring a new guy takes time).</p></div><p>Some students try to learn the subject and apply it in the project at the same time. This is usually a bad idea; the first time you use something you rarely use it the correct way, and it will be confusing for the other team members if you redo your tasks many times just because you didn&#39;t knew how to do it properly the first time. Therefor it&#39;s better if each team member has her own <em>practice project</em> of some kind she can use to really learn the subject, and then apply it to the real project when she has experience of the subject. It might feel like a waste of time, but it&#39;s not: what will take most time is to learn the subject; to implement something when you already know the subject takes very little time.</p><div class="custom-container tip"><p class="custom-container-title">Learn first, implement then</p><p>We strongly recommend students to first try to use something new they have learned in their own practice applications, and then, when they have learned how to use it properly, go ahead and use it in the project.</p></div>',11),Ee={},Me=(0,n(3744).Z)(Ee,[["render",function(e,t){const
