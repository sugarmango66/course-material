But first some introduction to why even small mistakes are very bad.</p><h2 id="why-are-small-mistakes-such-a-big-deal" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#why-are-small-mistakes-such-a-big-deal" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Why are small mistakes such a big deal?</h2><p>Many students think that many of the common mistakes mentioned in this lecture are something they don&#39;t need to worry about. <em>My code compiles, it works as intended, so what&#39;s the problem?</em> Well, the problem is that these students have only thought about delivering a <em>functional</em> solution, not a <em>good</em> solution. These students often think that they are the only ones who ever will read the code they write, or maybe even that no one at all will ever read the code they write, but that is usually not the case:</p><ul><li>When the application has been fully implemented, a <em>quality assurance expert</em> might read all the code so she can guarantee customers you deliver what has been agreed on. Then it&#39;s very important the code is easy to read.</li><li>When the application has been fully implemented, a <em>security expert</em> might read all the code so she can guarantee customers the application doesn&#39;t contain any known security vulnerabilities. Then it&#39;s very important the code is easy to read.</li><li>After the application has been fully implemented, <em>customers might discover bugs</em> that needs to be fixed. A programmer other than you might be assigned the task to fix the bug (you might for example have started to work on other projects and are busy with them), and then it&#39;s very important the code is easy to read for the new programmer.</li><li>After the application has been fully implemented, <em>customers might want additional features</em> added to the application. A programmer other than you might be assigned the task to add it (you might for example have started to work on other projects and are busy with them), and then it&#39;s very important the code is easy to read for the new programmer.</li><li>Etc.</li></ul><p>When your code is executed by a computer, it is very important that the code is fully functional and, if not optimized, at least not terribly slow. But it is even more important that others easily can read your code, because humans are much more expensive to use than computers. For example, if you have written good code that is easy to read, a security expert might need one day to look through all the code in the application to verify that it doesn&#39;t contain any known security vulnerabilities. But if the code instead is hard to read, she might need a week to do that. And if she is having difficulties to read the code, so will the quality assurance guy, who also needs a week instead of a single day to look through the code. And when adding a new feature in the future, which would take 4 hours to do with good code, will take 3 days with the bad code, and most likely new bugs are introduced with this new feature because the programmer who added it didn&#39;t understand how all the existing code worked, so she made assumptions of how parts of the code worked instead of knowing, and some of these assumptions will be wrong and need to be corrected later.</p><p>So, a programmer that is lazy and considers himself to be finish when the code is functional is not a good programmer. <strong>When the code is functional, you are half way there</strong>: you have implemented the feature in such way that computers can execute your code. Half of your work remains: to improve the quality of the code by re-structuring it and making it more readable so other humans easily can understand how your code works.</p><h2 id="but-why-are-small-mistakes-such-a-big-deal" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#but-why-are-small-mistakes-such-a-big-deal" aria-hidden="true">#</a> But why are <em>small</em> mistakes such a big deal?</h2><p><em>OK, I misspelled the name of a variable once, and at a few places I didn&#39;t stick to my indentation convention. Other humans can still read and understand my code although these small mistakes exist, what&#39;s the big deal?</em></p><p>Programmers are only humans, so one or two of these mistakes in 5 000 lines of code are understandable. But if more than that exists, it&#39;s simply a job poorly done by the programmer. Programming is quite abstract and can be hard to understand, so let&#39;s compare it to other professions:</p><ul><li>Do you think a painter do a good job if he paints 99.9% of the wall in one color, but there&#39;s a small line in the middle of the wall in another color?<br><em>What&#39;s the big deal, it&#39;s only a small line</em>?</li><li>Do you think a car manufacturer do a good job if the steering wheel only works 99.9% of the cases?<br><em>What&#39;s the big deal, you can still steer the car most of the time</em>?</li><li>Do you think an author do a good job if all sentences in her book always start with a lower case character?<br><em>What&#39;s the big deal, most characters are in the correct case</em>?</li></ul><p>Hopefully you agree in these other professions, even small mistakes, such as those listed above, are quite bad, so for students studying to these professions it&#39;s very important to learn that these small mistakes are not acceptable. The same is true for students studying programming, the only difference is that it&#39;s harder for beginners to realize that small programming mistakes are just as bad as the mistakes listed above.</p><p>Of course there are some nice xkcd:s about code quality:</p>',13),o={href:"https://xkcd.com/1513/",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener
