One difference is that the number 163 maps to different characters. So if one would save the text <code>Ä£Ö</code> in ISO Latin-1, and then open it in ISO Latin-2, it would display <code>ÄŁÖ</code>! This is a good example of why it&#39;s important to save the text and open it using the same character encoding.</p><h3 id="other-extensions-to-ascii" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#other-extensions-to-ascii" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Other extensions to ASCII</h3><p>In addition to ISO Latin-1 and ISO Latin-2, there exists many other character encodings that extends ASCII. One of them is <em>Windows-1252</em>, another one is <em>Windows-1250</em>, etc.</p><h3 id="unicode" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#unicode" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Unicode</h3><p>It is quite hard to work with text when you need to keep track of which character encoding to use. The <em>Unicode</em> project was started to solve this problem. It defines a charset that contains as good as all characters in the world, as well as several different character encodings that maps the characters to numbers.</p><h4 id="utf-32" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#utf-32" aria-hidden="true">#</a> UTF-32</h4><p>In the character encoding <em>UTF-32</em>, each character is mapped to a 32 bit (4 bytes) number. This makes it easy to understand how it works. The downside is that each character takes 4 times more space compared to ASCII. Therefore this character encoding is rarely used.</p><h4 id="utf-8" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#utf-8" aria-hidden="true">#</a> UTF-8</h4><p>In the character encoding <em>UTF-8</em>, each character is mapped to 8 bits (1 byte), 16 bits (2 bytes), 24 bits (3 bytes) or 32 bits (4 bytes). The characters used in ASCII (the most commonly used characters) are mapped to 8 bits the very same way as in ASCII, so UTF-8 is backward compatible with ASCII (you can save a text in ASCII and then open it in UTF-8 and read it correctly). The less commonly used characters are mapped to 16, 24 or 32 bits. This way the size of the text is still quite small (since the most commonly used characters only takes 8 bits), and it&#39;s still possible to use all the less commonly used characters in the text.</p><p>The downside with UTF-8 compared to UTF-32 is that the text is a bit harder to process, since each character is implemented with either 1, 2, 3 or 4 bytes. For example, to figure out how many characters a string in UTF-32 contains, you just need to divide the number of bytes in it by 4. In UTF-8 you need to go through the string byte by byte and count each character you come across, which takes more time.</p><h3 id="which-encoding-to-use" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#which-encoding-to-use" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Which encoding to use?</h3><p>These days you should most often use UTF-8. It&#39;s the default encoding used in more and more applications. Optimally, everyone would use the same character encoding, but today there still exists many old applications that use ASCII or one of the character encodings extending ASCII, so you still need to be aware of character encodings when you work with those applications.</p>',12),gt={},wt=(0,l(3744).Z)(gt,[["render",function(t,e){const l=(0,n.up)("OutboundLink"),gt=(0,n.up)("FigureNumber"),wt=(0,n.up)("Figure");return(0,n.wg)(),(0,n.iD)(n.HY,null,[a,r,d,s,(0,n._)("ul",null,[(0,n._)("li",null,[(0,n._)("a",u,[o,(0,n.Wm)(l)])]),(0,n._)("li",null,[(0,n._)("a",c,[i,(0,n.Wm)(l)]),h]),_]),m,p,(0,n._)("p",null,[b,g,w,f,y,k,x,I,U,v,S,C,A,(0,n.Wm)(gt),T]),(0,n.Wm)(wt,{caption:"A program in C printing 'Peter' on the screen."},{default:(0,n.w5)((()=>[W])),_:1}),O,(0,n._)("p",null,[E,F,L,P,N,(0,n.Wm)(gt),j]),(0,n.Wm)(wt,{caption:"One way to map the characters in the plocko charset to numbers."},{default:(0,n.w5)((()=>[q])),_:1}),(0,n._)("p",null,[H,D,R,(0,n.Wm)(gt),M]),(0,n.Wm)(wt,{caption:"Another way to map the characters in the plocko charset into numbers."},{default:(0,n.w5)((()=>[z])),_:1}),(0,n._)("p",null,[B,(0,n._)("a",J,[V,(0,n.Wm)(l)]),Z,(0,n._)("a",K,[Y,G,Q,(0,n.Wm)(l)]),X]),$,(0,n._)("p",null,[tt,et,lt,(0,n.Wm)(gt),nt]),(0,n.Wm)(wt,{caption:"The ASCII character encoding."},{default:(0,n.w5)((()=>[at])),_:1}),rt,(0,n._)("p",null,[dt,st,(0,n.Wm)(gt),ut]),(0,n.Wm)(wt,{caption:"Parts of the ISO Latin-1 character encoding."},{default:(0,n.w5)((()=>[ot])),_:1}),ct,it,(0,n._)("p",null,[ht,_t,(0,n.Wm)(gt),mt]),(0,n.Wm)(wt,{caption:"Parts of the ISO Latin-2 character encoding."},{default:(0,n.w5)((()=>[pt])),_:1}),bt],64)}]])},3744:(t,e)=>{e.Z=(t,e)=>{const l=t.__vccOpts||t;for(const[t,n]of e)l[t]=n;return l}},5074:(t,e,l)=>{l.r(e),l.d(e,{data:()=>n});const n={key:"v-91f742d8",path:"/lectures/character-encodings/",title:"Character Encodings",lang:"en-US",frontmatter:{sidebar:"auto",navbarTitle:"Character Encodings"},excerpt:"",headers:[{level:2,title:"Lecture material",slug:"lecture-material",children:[]},{level:2,title:"Recommended reading",slug:"recommended-reading",children:[]},{level:2,title:"Character Encodings",slug:"character-encodings-1",children:[{level:3,title:"Charset VS Character Encoding",slug:"charset-vs-character-encoding",children:[]},{level:3,title:"The problem with character encodings",slug:"the-problem-with-character-encodings",children:[]},{level:3,title:"ASCII",slug:"ascii",children:[]},{level:3,title:"ISO Latin-1",slug:"iso-latin-1",children:[]},{level:3,title:"ISO Latin-2",slug:"iso-latin-2",children:[]},{level:3,title:"Other extensions to ASCII",slug:"other-extensions-to-ascii",children:[]},{level:3,title:"Unicode",slug:"unicode",children:[]},{level:3,title:"Which encoding to use?",slug:"which-encoding-to-use",children:[]}]}],filePathRelative:"lectures/character-encodings/README.md",git:{updatedTime:1598182318e3}}}}]);
