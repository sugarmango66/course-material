In many web frameworks, a session only exists for 20 minutes (can usually be configured), but each time the user visits a new page on the website, those 20 minutes are &quot;refreshed&quot;, and the session will continue to live for 20 minutes again. That means if you start to use a website, you get a new session the server can use to remember information about you, and if you don&#39;t send a new HTTP request within 20 minutes, that session will be deleted, and the server will forget all the information it had stored about you in your session. With the next HTTP request you send to the server after 20 minutes, you will get a new session.</p><div class="custom-container tip"><p class="custom-container-title">Example</p><p>You might have noticed that if you login on a website, start reading a long page for ~30 minutes, and then go to another page on the website, that you are not logged in anymore? That&#39;s because the session has been deleted since you haven&#39;t been active on (sent HTTP request to) that website for a while.

When should you use which one? A rule of thumb is that you should use sessions if you need to remember temporary information about a client the client should not have access to. Otherwise, a cookie might be the better choice.</p><div class="custom-container tip"><p class="custom-container-title">Example</p><p>If you need to remember which account a client has logged in to, then you should remember this in the client&#39;s session, because you don&#39;t want the client to be able to change this information.</p></div><div class="custom-container tip"><p class="custom-container-title">Example</p><p>If you want to remember which words the user has searched for in the search form on your website, then you might be better of storing that information in a cookie. The user only harms herself by modifying the cookie, and by using a cookie, we can remember that information for a much longer time compared to using a session.</p><p>One downside with using a cookie in this example is that the cookie will be passed to the server with every single request the client makes. For cookies containing little data, this is probably not a problem, but if the cookie contains a lot of data, this might slow down the performance, and it will increase the user&#39;s data usage, which is bad if the user has a limited data plan.</p></div><h2 id="how-are-sessions-implemented" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#how-are-sessions-implemented" aria-hidden="true">#</a> How are sessions implemented?</h2><p>Session might sound complicated, but they are most often very easy to use, because the framework/libraries we use have implemented a nice interface for us through which we can use sessions without having to bother about the details ourselves.</p><p>How the server store the session on the server is up to the server to decide. It could store the sessions in temporary files, or it could store the sessions in a database.
