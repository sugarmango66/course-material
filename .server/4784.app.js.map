This is especially true when the repository only exists locally on your own computer, because then the repository only have a single branch (a default branch) called <code>master</code> or <code>main</code>, and you can more or less ignore the fact that branches exist in Git, even though you do work on the <code>master</code>/<code>main</code> branch all the time. But most often, this is not the case, and you need to have a basic understanding of how branches work in Git for you to use Git in best way possible. Furthermore, Linus Torvalds designed Git around the usage of branches, so they play a very central role in Git.</p>\n<div class=\"custom-container warning\"><p class=\"custom-container-title\">master VS main</p>\n<p>If you create your repository on your own computer using the <code>git init</code> command, then the default branch is called <code>master</code>. If you create your repository on a server, that you then clone to your own computer (read more about this in next lecture), then the default branch may have another name. For example, <a href=\"https://github.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GitHub<OutboundLink/></a> names the default branch <code>main</code>.</p>\n<p>In these lectures we use <code>master</code> as the default name.</p>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-a-branch\" tabindex=\"-1\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#what-is-a-branch\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a> What is a branch?</h2>\n<p>We usually use commits to remember earlier versions of the project, but we can also use commits to work on different versions of the project at the same time. This is the case when the repository does not consists of a single chain of commits. An example of that would be a repository consisting of the following commits:</p>\n<div class=\"language-text ext-text line-numbers-mode\"><pre v-pre class=\"language-text\"><code>                       Commit 4                HEAD\n                          ↓                      ↓ \nCommit 1      &lt;--      Commit 2      &lt;--      Commit 3\n</code></pre><div class=\"line-numbers\"><span class=\"line-number\">1</span><br><span class=\"line-number\">2</span><br><span class=\"line-number\">3</span><br></div></div><p>Here we can see that we have two different latest versions of the project represented by <code>Commit 4</code> and <code>Commit 3</code> respectively. They both contain features/functionalities the other version does not contain, and we say that we have two branches of the project at <code>Commit 2</code>. To know which version of the project we are working on, Git uses the <code>HEAD</code> pointer, so in this case we can see that we are currently working on the branch with <code>Commit 3</code> (if we would create a new commit, that commit would point to <code>Commit 3</code>).</p>\n<p>So, a <em>branch</em> is simply a separate line of commits that takes the project in a different direction.</p>\n<p>By default, there exists a single branch called <code>master</code>, which usually is used for the &quot;main version&quot; of the project. As long as you don't create a new branch and switch to it, you always work on the <code>master</code> branch.</p>\n<p>In practice, a branch is just a pointer that points to the latest commit in that branch. The <code>HEAD</code> pointer in turn points to the branch you are currently working on.</p>\n<div class=\"custom-container warning\"><p class=\"custom-container-title\">Note</p>\n<p>To simplify, we said in the previous lecture that <code>HEAD</code> pointed to the latest commit. This is wrong; <code>HEAD</code> points to the branch you are currently working on.</p>\n</div>\n<p>A repository with a single branch (the <code>master</code> branch only) and two commits would look like this:</p>\n<div class=\"language-text ext-text line-numbers-mode\"><pre v-pre class=\"language-text\"><code>                        HEAD\n                          ↓\n                    MASTER BRANCH\n                          ↓\nCommit 1      &lt;--      Commit 2\n</code></pre><div class=\"line-numbers\"><span class=\"line-number\">1</span><br><span class=\"line-number\">2</span><br><span class=\"line-number\">3</span><br><span class=\"line-number\">4</span><br><span class=\"line-number\">5</span><br></div></div><p>Then when you create a new commit, the <code>master</code> branch pointer is changed to point to the newly created commit:</p>\n<div class=\"language-text ext-text line-numbers-mode\"><pre v-pre class=\"language-text\"><code>                                               HEAD\n                                                 ↓\n                                           MASTER BRANCH\n                                                 ↓\nCommit 1      &lt;--      Commit 2      &lt;--      Commit 3\n</code></pre><div class=\"line-numbers\"><span class=\"line-number\">1</span><br><span class=\"line-number\">2</span><br><span class=\"line-number\">3</span><br><span class=\"line-number\">4</span><br><span class=\"line-number\">5</span><br></div></div><h2 id=\"creating-branches\" tabindex=\"-1\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#creating-branches\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a> Creating branches</h2>\n<p>It is possible to create a new branch using the command <code>git reset --hard XXX</code>, but Git have better support for working with branches through other commands that are better to use.</p>\n<p>The best way to create a new branch is by using the command <code>git branch BRANCH_NAME</code>. This create a new branch with the name <code>BRANCH_NAME</code> that points to the commit your current branch is pointing to. Note that this command only creates the branch, it does not switch to that branch, so we are still working on the same branch as we were on before.</p>\n<div class=\"custom-container tip\"><p class=\"custom-container-title\">Example</p>\n<p>If your repository looks like this:</p>\n<div class=\"language-text ext-text line-numbers-mode\"><pre v-pre class=\"language-text\"><code>                        HEAD\n                          ↓\n                    MASTER BRANCH\n                          ↓\nCommit 1      &lt;--      Commit 2\n</code></pre><div class=\"line-numbers\"><span class=\"line-number\">1</span><br><span class=\"line-number\">2</span><br><span class=\"line-number\">3</span><br><span class=\"line-number\">4</span><br><span class=\"line-number\">5</span><br></div></div><p>And you then run the command <code>git branch test</code>, then your repository would look like this:</p>\n<div class=\"language-text ext-text line-numbers-mode\"><pre v-pre class=\"language-text\"><code>                        HEAD\n                          ↓\n                    MASTER BRANCH\n                          ↓\nCommit 1      &lt;--      Commit 2\n                          ↑\n                      TEST BRANCH\n</code></pre><div class=\"line-numbers\"><span class=\"line-number\">1</span><br><span class=\"line-number\">2</span><br><span class=\"line-number\">3</span><br><span class=\"line-number\">4</span><br><span class=\"line-number\">5</span><br><span class=\"line-number\">6</span><br><span class=\"line-number\">7</span><br></div></div></div>\n<h2 id=\"switching-branches\" tabindex=\"-1\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#switching-branches\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a> Switching branches</h2>\n<p>To change which branch you are working on, you use the command <code>git checkout BRANCH_NAME</code>.

But why would you want that? In the end, you only want to have a single version of the project that contains all the features/functionalities, and not 5 different versions that each contains a fifth of all the functionalities, right?</p>\n<p>When you have two branches, you can merge the work you have done (the commits) in one of them into the other. You do that by creating a special type of commit called a <em>merge commit</em>. A merge commit is a new commit that points to the latest commit in each of the two branches, so this new commit will contain the features/functionality from both branches.</p>\n<p>When you have created a merge commit, the commits in a repository can look like this:</p>\n<div class=\"language-text ext-text line-numbers-mode\"><pre v-pre class=\"language-text\"><code>                                               HEAD\n                                                 ↓\n                                           MASTER BRANCH\n                                                 ↓\n                       Commit 4      &lt;--      Commit 5\n                          ↓                      ↓ \nCommit 1      &lt;--      Commit 2      &lt;--      Commit 3\n                                                 ↑\n                                             TEST BRANCH\n</code></pre><div class=\"line-numbers\"><span class=\"line-number\">1</span><br><span class=\"line-number\">2</span><br><span class=\"line-number\">3</span><br><span class=\"line-number\">4</span><br><span class=\"line-number\">5</span><br><span class=\"line-number\">6</span><br><span class=\"line-number\">7</span><br><span class=\"line-number\">8</span><br><span class=\"line-number\">9</span><br></div></div><p><code>Commit 5</code> will now contain the features/functionality from both <code>Commit 4</code> and <code>Commit 3</code>, and can now be seen as the single latest version of the project.</p>\n<div class=\"custom-container warning\"><p class=\"custom-container-title\">Merging can be hard!</p>\n<p>Creating merge commits can be a little bit complicated; you can have merge conflicts (contradictive changes to the source code in the two different branches)) that you need to handle.

Turns out that branches are really useful during development. Especially when multiple programmers work on the same project at the same time, because a programmer don't want to be disturbed by commits from other programmers that might interfere with the programmer's own work before it is finished. So each programmer can create their own branch which the other programmers won't interfere with, and when the programmer is done with all of her work on that branch, she can share her work with the other programmers by merging it with the <code>master</code> branch. It can for example look like this (let's ignore the <code>HEAD</code> pointer, because it is not important in this example):</p>\n<div class=\"language-text ext-text line-numbers-mode\"><pre v-pre class=\"language-text\"><code>                       Commit 3      &lt;--      Commit 6      &lt;--      ALICE BRANCH\n                          ↓\nCommit 1      &lt;--      Commit 2      &lt;--      MASTER BRANCH\n                          ↑\n                       Commit 4      &lt;--      Commit 5      &lt;--      BOB BRANCH\n</code></pre><div class=\"line-numbers\"><span class=\"line-number\">1</span><br><span class=\"line-number\">2</span><br><span class=\"line-number\">3</span><br><span class=\"line-number\">4</span><br><span class=\"line-number\">5</span><br></div></div><p>When Alice is done with her work, she merges her branch with the <code>master</code> branch:</p>\n<div class=\"language-text ext-text line-numbers-mode\"><pre v-pre class=\"language-text\"><code>                       Commit 3      &lt;--      Commit 6\n                          ↓                      ↑\nCommit 1      &lt;--      Commit 2      &lt;--      Commit 7      &lt;--      MASTER BRANCH (now also containing Alice's work)\n                          ↑\n                       Commit 4      &lt;--      Commit 5      &lt;--      BOB BRANCH\n</code></pre><div class=\"line-numbers\"><span class=\"line-number\">1</span><br><span class=\"line-number\">2</span><br><span class=\"line-number\">3</span><br><span class=\"line-number\">4</span><br><span class=\"line-number\">5</span><br></div></div><p>And when Bob is done with his work, he merges his work with the <code>master</code> branch:</p>\n<div class=\"language-text ext-text line-numbers-mode\"><pre v-pre class=\"language-text\"><code>                       Commit 3      &lt;--      Commit 6\n                          ↓                      ↑\nCommit 1      &lt;--      Commit 2      &lt;--      Commit 7      &lt;--      Commit 8      &lt;--      MASTER BRANCH (now containing both Alice's work and Bob's work)\n                          ↑                                             |\n                       Commit 4      &lt;--      Commit 5      &lt;-----------┙\n</code></pre><div class=\"line-numbers\"><span class=\"line-number\">1</span><br><span class=\"line-number\">2</span><br><span class=\"line-number\">3</span><br><span class=\"line-number\">4</span><br><span class=\"line-number\">5</span><br></div></div><div class=\"custom-container warning\"><p class=\"custom-container-title\">Note</p>\n<p>How multiple programmers sitting at different computers can work on the same repository (to synch commits) is not something we cover in this lecture, but Git has special support for this which we will cover in next lecture.</p>\n</div>\n<p>There are more use-cases for branches than just &quot;one branch per programmer&quot;. For example, if you create a library, then you might want to have one branch for each major version of the library you have, so you conveniently can switch between them. This way, it is easy to fix bugs/security vulnerabilities in older versions of the library, and to add new features in the latest version of the library. Or maybe you just want to test something new which you don't know if you'll have any use of.
