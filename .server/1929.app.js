Easy, right? ðŸ™‚ But you simply saying <code>I&#39;ve proved that frictionless wheels exist</code> does not make it so, and much less will anyone else believe you just because you are saying it. Science is not built on opinions or made-up facts created by random guys, but on <strong>proved</strong> and <strong>verifiable</strong> facts.</p><p>So, to contribute to science, you have to come up with a new statement, such as <code>Frictionless wheels exist</code>, and then prove that the statement is true or false. You also need to provide a way for others to verify that your conclusion (that the statement is true/false) is correct. You do that by documenting how you came to the conclusion that the statement is true/false, so others then can reproduce your work and come to the same conclusion (and this way verify that your conclusion is correct). This way, all scientific facts are accepted as true by all scientist, and anyone doubting an accepted fact should be able to reproduce your work to be convinced that it actually is true (or fail to reproduce it, which would mean that your concluded fact is wrong).</p><p>When doing research, you usually don&#39;t start out by specifying the statement you want to prove as true/false, but with questions (known as <em>Research Questions</em>) that you intend to answer, and when you know the answers to these questions you can draw new conclusions/produce new facts. For example, the fact <code>Frictionless wheels exist</code> might come from a research project that had the research question <code>Which material has lowest friction while spinning?</code>, and when gathering data to answer this question they found that <code>Material X</code> had no friction at all, after which they could produce the fact <code>Frictionless wheels exist</code>.</p><div class="custom-container warning"><p class="custom-container-title">I know...</p><p><em>Frictionless wheels</em> is a really bad example, but why not? ðŸ˜„</p></div><p>For others to more easily understand your work and to be able reproduce your work, you document it in a report.</p><h2 id="report" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#report" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Report</h2><p>The report you document your work in usually contains the following chapters:</p><ol><li>Introduction</li><li>Theoretical Framework</li><li>Method</li></ol><p>This structure will make it very easy for others to quickly understand what your work is about, and easily be able to verify that your conclusions in the end are valid.</p><h3 id="chapter-1-introduction" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#chapter-1-introduction" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Chapter 1: Introduction</h3><p>The goal with this chapter is to tell the reader which Research Questions you intend to answer in your work. But before you tell the reader which your Research Questions are, you have to convince the reader that finding the answers to them is really important and worth investing money in.</p><p>When writing this chapter, you can often think of the reader as a rich and uneducated investor. She has the money you need to carry out your work (money covering work hours, machines you need to buy, etc.), so you need to convince her that finding the answers to your Research Questions is really important, and worth investing money in. But she doesn&#39;t know your area of expertise, so in this chapter you should first give her a background of the area you are investigating.</p><p>For example, if your work is about <code>Reducing a car&#39;s fuel consumption</code>, first explain what cars are and why they are important to mankind, then give a quick and short introduction to how cars work, and then explain why it&#39;s good to make cars even better and what knowledge that is missing in this area/sub-areas to make them even better, such as:</p><ul><li>Unknown how tires can be optimized to reduce friction to the road</li><li>Unknown how road material can be optimized to reduce friction to tires</li><li>Unknown how air resistance can be minimized</li><li>Etc.</li></ul><div class="custom-container tip"><p class="custom-container-title">Refer to previous research!</p><p>In research, you claiming something doesn&#39;t simply make it so. You need to backup all your claims with sources. If you can&#39;t find a scientific source for a claim, than maybe your own research should be about proving that claim?</p><p>By referring to good research done by others in the area, you also convinced the reader that you are up-to date with the latest research in the area, and that you don&#39;t redo a work another researched did 20 years ago by accident.</p></div><p>In addition to explaining what the missing knowledge is, you also need to explain the benefits with finding the knowledge, such as:</p><ul><li>Less Carbon Dioxide released into the atmosphere by cars would slow down global warming</li><li>Less money would be spent on gasoline, so more money would be left over to spend on more important things (such as research! ðŸ˜„)</li><li>Etc.</li></ul><p>Most likely you can&#39;t find all the missing knowledge (that would be a way too big work), so you must also tell the reader which of these sub-areas you choose to work with, and explain that sub-area in a bit more detail. Then, finally, you can tell the reader which your Research Questions are. When the reader, who before reading your report knew nothing about your area of expertise at all, now reads your Research Questions, she will understand why your Research Questions are important to answer and worth investing money in.</p><div class="custom-container tip"><p class="custom-container-title">Start broad, then go deep, then go broad again</p><p>When describing your area of expertise, you start broad (e.g. by explaining what a car is), and then go deeper and deeper into to details (e.g. by explaining that internally a car contains an engine consuming fuel that moves the car forward, etc.), until you have reached the specific area with the missing knowledge. So you start broad, and then go deep.</p><p>When you have explained the problems in your specific area, you can then try to generalize the problem, so you make it broader and applicable to more domains than just your specific example. This will make your problem even more worth to investigate. For example, the problems in <code>Reducing a car&#39;s fuel consumption</code> can be broaden by explaining that trucks, steam locomotives, etc. all could benefit from your findings here, since trucks and steam locomotives also consume fuel to make their tires rotate.</p></div><div class="custom-container danger"><p class="custom-container-title">Check questions</p><p>You can consider yourself done with this chapter when the answers to the following questions is <code>Yes</code>:</p><ol><li>Does both your parents understand what your Research Questions mean?</li><li>Does both your parents understand why it is important to answer your Research Questions?</li><li>Does both your parents understand who would benefit from knowing the answers to your Research Questions, and how they would benefit from them?</li></ol></div><h2 id="theoretical-framework" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#theoretical-framework" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Theoretical Framework</h2><p>Explain the theoretical knowledge a reader needs to have to understand the rest of your work. This way, people who aren&#39;t expertise in your area will still be able to read and understand all of your report after they have read this chapter. And people who are expertise in your area can read through this chapter to verify that you (the author of the report) know what you are talking about.</p><div class="custom-container tip"><p class="custom-container-title">Don&#39;t refer to your project!</p><p>Optimally, your theoretical framework should just be about existing theory; you don&#39;t need to mention your specific work at all in this chapter (that&#39;s what the other chapters are for!). Optimally written, one should be able to copy-paste text from this chapter into the Theoretical Framework of another scientific report which is about the same subject, without having to change a thing.</p></div><div class="custom-container danger"><p class="custom-container-title">Check questions</p><p>You can consider yourself done with this chapter when the answer to the following questions is <code>Yes</code>:</p><ol><li>Does both your parents understand the rest of your report after they have read this chapter?</li><li>Will an expert in your area get the understanding that you know what you are doing?</li></ol></div><h2 id="method" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#method" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Method</h2><p>To answer your Research Questions, you usually need to gather some data. For example, to answer the Research Question <code>Which material has lowest friction while spinning?</code>, you would need to measure the <em>spinning friction</em> (whatever that is ðŸ˜‚) for each type of material in the entire universe. If you can&#39;t do this, you would need to go back to Chapter 1 and rephrase your Research Question to better reflect what you are actually doing, such as <code>Which material on earth has lowest friction while spinning?</code>.</p><p>In this chapter you should explain what data you gather, how you gather your data, and how the data will help you answer your Research Questions. You should also convince the reader that your method is the best method to gather the data you need to answer your Research Questions, so often you don&#39;t only need to motivate why you&#39;re chosen method is the best one, but why other&#39;s methods you could have used were not chosen.</p><p>The method you use needs to be described in such detail that others can reproduce your work. If not enough information is provided for others to reproduce your work, it doesn&#39;t matter how</p><!--]-->`)
