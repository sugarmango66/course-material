Often when you work with files and folders, you are only interested in the files and sub-folders in a specific folder. Then you can set that specific folder as your Working Directory, and then you can refer to the other files and folders using a <em>relative path</em> from your Working Directory, instead of using the absolute path from the root folder. This is usually much more convenient. Relative paths work like this:</p><ul><li><code>some-name</code> <br> Refers to the file (or folder) with the name <code>some-name</code> in the Working Directory</li><li><code>a-sub-folder/some-name</code> <br> Refers to the file (or folder) with the name <code>some-name</code> in the sub folder <code>a-sub-folder</code> in the Working Directory. You can add more <code>/</code> to go into more sub folders</li><li><code>.</code> <br> Refers to the folder you are standing in (the Working Directory)</li><li><code>..</code> <br> Refers to the parent directory of the folder you are standing in. Can be used repeatedly and together with the other notations. For example, <code>../..</code> is the parent folder to the parent folder you are standing in, and <code>../a-file.txt</code> refers to the file <code>a-file.txt</code> in the parent folder</li></ul><div class="custom-container warning"><p class="custom-container-title">Do paths to folders end with /?</p><p>If a path refers to a folder, it can end with <code>/</code>, but it&#39;s not required to write that. For example, both <code>/a-sub-folder</code> and <code>/a-sub-folder/</code> would refer to the same folder. However, it can be good to add that extra slash at the end to indicate to other humans reading the path that the path leads to a folder, since they might otherwise think it leads to a file.</p><p>In addition to that, some commands will in some contexts work differently depending on the presence of the ending <code>/</code>.
