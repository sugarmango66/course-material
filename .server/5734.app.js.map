So you need to setup some rules for how the team should work, and then all team members need to adapt and follow these rules. <strong>The individuals need to adapt to the team, the team should not adapt to individuals!</strong></p>\n<h3 id=\"setup-a-file-repository\" tabindex=\"-1\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#setup-a-file-repository\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a> Setup a File Repository</h3>\n<p>A project usually results in many files, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reports</li>\n<li>Mockups</li>\n<li>Prototypes</li>\n<li>Source files</li>\n<li>Power Point presentations</li>\n<li>Meeting notes</li>\n<li>Etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is crucial that all team members have easy access to these files, so everyone easily can read and change them. To share the files with each others, you can try to use something simple as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Email the new versions of the files to everybody in the team when you have made changes to them.</li>\n<li>Use Dropbox/OneDrive/Google Drive/Etc. to automatically send the latest version of the files to a server all have access to.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These ways are tempting to use in the beginning since it's very easy to get started, <strong>BUT</strong> very soon it will be very hard to keep track of the files, such as when one team member forgets to send an email to everybody, or uses another topic in the email than what you agreed on, or one member introduces a temporary bug while implementing a new feature, and Dropbox automatically sends that file to the server and now the rest of the team members can't run their code because of this bug ðŸ˜‘</p>\n<div class=\"custom-container tip\"><p class=\"custom-container-title\">Use Git</p>\n<p>We recommend you to use a proper Version Control System, such as <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Git<OutboundLink/></a>, to share your files with each other. In addition to have been designed to be used by users who need to share files with each other, it is standard to use a Version Control System in the industry, so just as good for you to learn how to use one already now. We recommend that you use Git (see the mini-course <a href=\"../../courses/git\">Git</a> for a small introduction), but you may use whichever Version Control System you want.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Deciding how to share files is one of the first things your team need to agree on, preferably at the very first meeting you have, so everybody knows how to access the notes from the meeting.</p>\n<h3 id=\"communication\" tabindex=\"-1\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#communication\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a> Communication</h3>\n<p>Throughout the project you need to communicate with each other. Sometimes the team needs to take a big decision, and then you need to have one communication channel to use use for that, such as physical meetings. Sometimes a team member needs to inform the others that the team needs to have a physical meeting to take a big decision, and then you need one communication channel for that, such as email or SMS. Sometimes one team member needs to communicate with one other team member to ask questions about code that other team member has written, and then you need one communication channel for that, such as phone or video calls, etc.</p>\n<p>Deciding how you should communicate with each other/which communication channels to use when is something you need to agree on in the beginning of the project too, preferably at the very first meeting you have, so everybody knows how to contact each other.</p>\n<div class=\"custom-container tip\"><p class=\"custom-container-title\">Use issues in GitHub</p>\n<p>We recommend you to use issues in a <a href=\"https://github.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GitHub<OutboundLink/></a> repository to communicate with each other. This way, all your communication and decisions will be documented, searchable, and available to everybody in the team, and you can easily <a href=\"https://github.blog/2011-03-23-mention-somebody-they-re-notified/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">@mention<OutboundLink/></a> your team members to notify them when their input is needed.</p>\n<p>Don't use issues like a chat, so don't create issues like <code>Help me Alice</code> (the topic of the issue does not reflect what information one can find in the issue), but create an issue about the problem you need help with/want to discuss, such as <code>Code about XXX needs better documentation</code>, and then @mention the person who best can help you.</p>\n</div>\n<h4 id=\"regular-meetings\" tabindex=\"-1\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#regular-meetings\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a> Regular Meetings</h4>\n<p>To get to know each other better and to make sure that each team member has something to work on it's a good idea to have regular meetings (for example Tuesdays 10:00 and Fridays 13:00 each week). This way each team member can quickly update the others on what:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The team member has done since the previous meeting</li>\n<li>Problems the team member has identified in his work since the previous meeting</li>\n<li>What the team member intends to work on until next meeting</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the beginning of the project it's good to have many small meetings (maybe every second day) since there's usually not much to do in the beginning for most team members (few tasks to do, and they are usually sequential). The second or third week there are usually more tasks that can be completed in parallel, and you can start having the meetings more rarely (maybe once a week). You decide how you want to do it.</p>\n<div class=\"custom-container tip\"><p class=\"custom-container-title\">Document your meetings in the repository</p>\n<p>We recommend you to have physical meetings every now and then (at least once each week in the beginning) to get to know each other better and have more efficient discussions. At each meeting, appoint a chairman and a secretary. The secretary should document all discussions and decisions taken at the meeting in a file (for example a Markdown file), which then is stored in your repository. This way, team members who can't attend the meeting can easily catch up, and if someone forgets what was said or disagree with what you have decided can go back and look in the file to recall.</p>\n<FigureNumber /> below contains a minimal meeting protocol you can use at your meetings (feel free to adopt it to your team).\n<Figure caption=\"Example of meeting protocol.\">\n<div class=\"language-markdown ext-md line-numbers-mode\"><pre v-pre class=\"language-markdown\"><code><span class=\"token list punctuation\">1.</span> Agree on who will be the meeting chairman (good to switch each meeting so you all get some practice)\n<span class=\"token list punctuation\">2.</span> Agree on who will be the meeting secretary (good to switch each meeting so you all get some practice)\n<span class=\"token list punctuation\">3.</span> Ask each team member which tasks they've been working on since the last meeting and how it's going\n<span class=\"token list punctuation\">4.</span> Identify new tasks in the project that needs to be completed\n<span class=\"token list punctuation\">5.</span> Assign tasks to team members they should work on til next meeting\n\n</code></pre><div class=\"line-numbers\"><span class=\"line-number\">1</span><br><span class=\"line-number\">2</span><br><span class=\"line-number\">3</span><br><span class=\"line-number\">4</span><br><span class=\"line-number\">5</span><br><span class=\"line-number\">6</span><br></div></div></Figure>\n<p>The meeting notes produced by the secretary could be as simple as the ones shown in <FigureNumber /> below.</p>\n<Figure caption=\"Example of meeting notes.\">\n<div class=\"language-markdown ext-md line-numbers-mode\"><pre v-pre class=\"language-markdown\"><code>Meeting date &amp; time: __________________\n\nChairman: __________________\n\nSecretary: ________________\n\nOther present team members: _______________________\n\n<span class=\"token list punctuation\">1.</span> Each team member presented their progress since the previous week:\n    <span class=\"token list punctuation\">-</span> Alice has completed Task X without problem\n    <span class=\"token list punctuation\">-</span> Bob discovered Task Y was much harder than expected because XXX\n    <span class=\"token list punctuation\">-</span> Claire has been sick and couldn't work on Task Z\n<span class=\"token list punctuation\">2.</span> The following new tasks were identified:\n    <span class=\"token list punctuation\">-</span> When Alice worked on Task X she realized it would be good to have Task U\n    <span class=\"token list punctuation\">-</span> Claire likes animations and thinks it would be good to use that in the project, which is Task V\n    <span class=\"token list punctuation\">-</span> Bob thinks it's better to divide his Task Y into the sub tasks Y1 and Y2\n<span class=\"token list punctuation\">3.</span> The team members should work on the following tasks til next meeting:\n    <span class=\"token list punctuation\">-</span> Alice should work on Task U\n    <span class=\"token list punctuation\">-</span> Bob should work on Task Y1 (almost done with it now) and Y2\n    <span class=\"token list punctuation\">-</span> Claire should work on Task Z and Task V\n<span class=\"token list punctuation\">4.</span> Next meeting is YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM\n</code></pre><div class=\"line-numbers\"><span class=\"line-number\">1</span><br><span class=\"line-number\">2</span><br><span class=\"line-number\">3</span><br><span class=\"line-number\">4</span><br><span class=\"line-number\">5</span><br><span class=\"line-number\">6</span><br><span class=\"line-number\">7</span><br><span class=\"line-number\">8</span><br><span class=\"line-number\">9</span><br><span class=\"line-number\">10</span><br><span class=\"line-number\">11</span><br><span class=\"line-number\">12</span><br><span class=\"line-number\">13</span><br><span class=\"line-number\">14</span><br><span class=\"line-number\">15</span><br><span class=\"line-number\">16</span><br><span class=\"line-number\">17</span><br><span class=\"line-number\">18</span><br><span class=\"line-number\">19</span><br><span class=\"line-number\">20</span><br><span class=\"line-number\">21</span><br></div></div></Figure>\n<p>A meeting protocol like this is valuable for all team members if a conflict should arise in the future. For example, if one student claims another student in the team has not contributed much to the project, the meeting notes together with the commit history and the issue discussions can be used to check what each student actually has contributed with.</p>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"divide-the-work-into-tasks\" tabindex=\"-1\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#divide-the-work-into-tasks\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a> Divide the work into tasks</h2>\n<p>When you have set up a Teamwork Environment you are ready to start implementing the application in the project. It's usually a bad idea that the entire team works on one and the same problem. For example, if you are 4 team members and you need to design your database, it's enough if just one team member works on that; there's no need for the other 3 team members to work on this task too. If they do, they'll most likely just sit and watch and waste their time watching the fourth member draw the database diagram instead of contributing to the project. So, to be efficient, it's crucial to divide the work among the team members.</p>\n<p>So, don't view the project as one big thing, as shown in <FigureNumber /> below.</p>\n<Figure caption=\"The entire project.\">\n<RenderMermaid graph-definition=\"\ngraph TB\n\tProject\n\" />\n</Figure>\n<p>Instead, view the project as a collection of tasks that needs to be completed, as shown in <FigureNumber /> below. When all tasks have been completed, the entire project has been completed. This way, each team member can then work on her own well-defined task, and contribute that way.</p>\n<Figure caption=\"Dividing the project into multiple smaller tasks.\">\n<RenderMermaid graph-definition=\"\ngraph LR\n    subgraph Project\n        a[Task A]\n        b[Task B]\n        c[Task C]\n        d[Task D]\n    end\n\" />\n</Figure>\n<p>How the work is divided into these tasks depends on what type of project it is, so it differs quite a lot from project to project. If you don't know how to do it, then an excellent first task that can be assigned to a team member is <em>Divide the project into multiple smaller tasks</em> ðŸ˜ƒ When you implement an application, each feature the application needs to contain can usually be expressed as a task (i.e. <em>Implement feature X</em>, like <em>Implement the guestbook page, which lists all guestbook posts users have written</em>).</p>\n<div class=\"custom-container tip\"><p class=\"custom-container-title\">Working on the same task</p>\n<p>For some tasks it can make sense for all team members to individually work on the same task independently of each other at the same time. For example, if the task is <em>Design the graphical user interface of the app</em>, it's not uncommon to test multiple different designs, and then go with the one that seems most promising. Here, each team member can come up with their own design, and then you can have a meeting where you present your designs to each other and discuss which one is the best.</p>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"parallel-tasks\" tabindex=\"-1\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#parallel-tasks\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a> Parallel tasks</h3>\n<p>In best case you'll manage to divide the work into multiple tasks that can be completed in parallel. That's great, because then all team members have different tasks to work on at the same time. For example, on a website, Alice can <em>Implement the guestbook page</em> and Bob can <em>Implement the contact page</em> in parallel because these tasks are independent of each other, as shown in <FigureNumber /> below.</p>\n<Figure caption='Example of parallel tasks (\"Implement the guestbook page\" and \"Implement the contact page\").'>\n<RenderMermaid graph-definition=\"\ngraph TB\n    subgraph Website Project\n        a[Create the layout]\n        b1[Implement the guestbook page]\n        b2[Implement the contact page]\n        c[Deliver website to customer]\n        a-->b1-->c\n        a-->b2-->c\n    end\n\" />\n</Figure>\n<h3 id=\"sequential-tasks\" tabindex=\"-1\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#sequential-tasks\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a> Sequential tasks</h3>\n<p>Sometimes you have tasks that must be completed in order, i.e. Task 1 must be completed before Task 2 can be started, and Task 2 must be completed before Task 3 can be started, and so on. An example of that is a website with a blog users can write comments on. Alice is responsible for implementing the blog page, and Bob is responsible for implementing the comment functionality on the blog posts. Bob can't start working on his task until Alice has completed her task, as shown in <FigureNumber /> below.</p>\n<Figure caption='Example of sequential tasks (all of them).'>\n<RenderMermaid graph-definition=\"\ngraph TB\n    subgraph Website Project\n        a[Create the layout]\n        b[Implement blog functionality]\n        c[Implement comment on blogposts functionality]\n        d[Deliver website to customer]\n        a-->b-->c-->d\n    end\n\" />\n</Figure>\n<p>Now Alice and Bob can't work at the same time, but this is still manageable. When Alice and Bob work they probably don't spend 100% of their work time on the project (they have other things to do too, like other projects to work on, or, if you are a student, other courses to work on). For example, if Alice and Bob could work on their tasks in parallel, they might need 4 days to complete all tasks, but they complete them during 8 days anyway, because they work on other stuff during those 8 days too, as shown in <FigureNumber /> below.</p>\n<Figure caption='Alice and Bob working on parallel tasks (and other projects (not shown)) independently of each other.'>\n<RenderMermaid graph-definition=\"\ngantt\n    title Alice's and Bob's work hours in the project\n    dateFormat  YYYY-MM-DD\n    section Alice\n    Task A1           :2021-01-01, 1d\n    Task A2           :2021-01-03, 1d\n    Task A3           :2021-01-06, 1d\n    Task A4           :2021-01-08, 1d\n    section Bob\n    Task B1      :2021-01-01, 1d\n    Task B2      :2021-01-04, 1d\n    Task B3      :2021-01-05, 1d\n    Task B4      :2021-01-06, 1d\n\" />\n</Figure>\n<p>For sequential tasks that needs to be completed in order, such as Alice has to complete her tasks before Bob can start working on his tasks, Alice probably needs to work 100% on her tasks the first days, and then Bob needs to work 100% on his tasks after that, as shown in <FigureNumber /> below, and they will then have completed all their tasks within the same amount of time as when they could work on the tasks in parallel.</p>\n<Figure caption='Alice and Bob working on sequential tasks in the project, so they need to coordinate when to work on this project, and when to work on other projects.'>\n<RenderMermaid graph-definition=\"\ngantt\n    title Alice's and Bob's work hours in the project\n    dateFormat  YYYY-MM-DD\n    section Alice\n    Task A1           :2021-01-01, 1d\n    Task A2           :2021-01-02, 1d\n    Task A3           :2021-01-03, 1d\n    Task A4           :2021-01-04, 1d\n    section Bob\n    Task B1      :2021-01-05, 1d\n    Task B2      :2021-01-06, 1d\n    Task B3      :2021-01-07, 1d\n    Task B4      :2021-01-08, 1d\n\" />\n</Figure>\n<p>So, with sequential tasks you will just be less flexible with when you can work on the task, but overall sequential tasks shouldn't take much longer time to complete than parallel tasks.</p>\n<p>Big and really serious projects can take this one step further and use a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gantt_chart\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Gantt Chart<OutboundLink/></a> to help them estimate how long time it will take until the project is finished.</p>\n<p>To encourage team members to complete their tasks it's a good idea to estimate how long time each task should take to complete and assign the task a deadline (you can do this together at your regular meetings). If the team member that has been assigned the task hasn't completed it before the deadline he needs to explain to the rest of the team why it takes him such a long time, and if he can't give a reasonable explanation he has probably just been lazy.</p>\n<FigureNumber /> below shows an example of tasks identified in a bigger project. At the start of the project it can be hard to identify all tasks, and the goal of the project will also sometimes change while you work on it, so it's not uncommon that tasks are added to/removed from the project as it progresses.\n<Figure caption='Example of tasks in a bigger project.'>\n<RenderMermaid graph-definition=\"\ngraph LR\n    subgraph Website Project\n        start1[Create database]\n        start2[Create website layout]\n        a1[Create blogposts table in DB]\n        a2a[Add create blogpost page]\n        a2b[Add show blogpost page]\n        a2c[Add edit blogpost page]\n        a2d[Add delete blogpost page]\n        b1[Create guestbookPosts table in DB]\n        b2a[Add create guestbook post page]\n        b2b[Add show guestbook posts page]\n        stop[Deliver to customer]\n        start1-->a1\n        start1-->b1\n        a1-->a2a\n        a1-->a2b\n        a1-->a2c\n        a1-->a2d\n        b1-->b2a\n        b1-->b2b\n        start2-->a2a\n        start2-->a2b\n        start2-->a2c\n        start2-->a2d\n        start2-->b2a\n        start2-->b2b\n        a2a-->stop\n        a2b-->stop\n        a2c-->stop\n        a2d-->stop\n        b2a-->stop\n        b2b-->stop\n    end\n\" />\n</Figure>\n<FigureNumber previous /> above is also a good example of that in the beginning of a project, there aren't many parallel tasks to work on, but that quickly changes.\n<div class=\"custom-container tip\"><p class=\"custom-container-title\">Document your tasks as issues in GitHub</p>\n<p>We recommend you to use <a href=\"https://guides.github.com/features/issues/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GitHub issues<OutboundLink/></a> to keep track of which tasks you have.

Therefore you'll want to verify that the work other team members have done has been done properly. This can be done at your regular meetings: when a team member has completed a task, ask him to explain how he has completed the task, and check if he can answer questions about it. For example, if one team member has been assigned the task to design the graphical user interface of an application, ask him questions like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Why did you put that link in the menu and not at place X?</li>\n<li>Why is the background color blue?</li>\n<li>Etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If he can't answer these questions, then he hasn't thought about them and he can improve his work by thinking about them and then re-design the graphical user interface.</p>\n<div class=\"custom-container tip\"><p class=\"custom-container-title\">Use Code reviews in GitHub</p>\n<p>We recommend you to use <a href=\"https://github.com/features/code-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Code Reviews in GitHub<OutboundLink/></a>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>When starting to work on a new task, create a new branch</li>\n<li>Carry out the task (i.e. implement the new feature) in the new branch</li>\n<li>Push the branch to the remote repository</li>\n<li>On GitHub, create a pull request to merge the changes in the new branch into the <code>main</code>/<code>master</code> branch</li>\n<li>When all team members have approved the request (after reviewing the code), apply the pull request</li>\n</ol>\n<p>GitHub has support for <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/approving-a-pull-request-with-required-reviews\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">only accepting code that has been approved by others<OutboundLink/></a>.

In practice that's usually not possible. The application is often too big for that, and one of the points with dividing the project into tasks is so that each team member can work on her own part of the project without knowing/without having to worry about the details in other parts of the project others are working on.</p>\n<p>To be more productive, one can assign each team member a role, and that team member is then responsible for knowing all there is to know that is associated with that role. For example, one team member might be responsible for designing the graphical user interface and implementing the overall layout of the application (i.e. the role <em>GUI expert</em>), another team member might be responsible for designing the structure of the database and write an API the application can use to communicate with it (i.e. the role <em>Database expert</em>), a third team member might be responsible for learning Bluetooth and write an API the application can use to communicate with other devices using Bluetooth (i.e. the role <em>Bluetooth expert</em>), etc.</p>\n<p>To have a role does not mean only that team member should work on tasks that are associated with that role. For example, the team member who is responsible for the database should not carry out all tasks that involves the database. Instead, this team member should be considered to be the database expert. This team member will probably do most of the work that involves the database (such as designing the structure of the database and to start implement the API one can use to communicate with it), but once the basics for this are done, any other team member should be able to work on tasks that involves making small changes to the database structure or the database API. If in doubt of how to do it, one can discuss the details with the database expert.</p>\n<div class=\"custom-container tip\"><p class=\"custom-container-title\">Give different team members different roles/responsibilities</p>\n<p>We recommend you to assign each team member one or more roles, so you specialize in different parts of the application. In the end, all students must know how all the code works, but it is OK if just one student is an expert and learn all there is to know about a technology, and then teaches the rest of the team members how your application makes use of that technology in best way possible.</p>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"learn-first-implement-then\" tabindex=\"-1\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#learn-first-implement-then\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a> Learn first, implement then</h2>\n<p>Projects carried out by students are not 100% the same as projects carried out by professionals. If a professional project manager puts together a team of her choice, she'll probably pick an experienced database manager to work on the database in the project, an experienced web developer to work on the website in the project, an experienced Android developer to work on the Android application in the project, etc. These experienced workers already know the area they are responsible for in the project, so it's quite straight forward for them to contribute with their parts to the project.</p>\n<p>Students on the other hand are not experienced professionals. Often they don't know the subject they are responsible for in the project in advance, and first need to learn the subject and then implement the part they are responsible for. This is of course much harder! It might feel a bit unfair, but remember that students have more time to work on their projects than what professionals do, and the reason for this is of course so that students can learn the subject at the same time, so it's not as bad as it first might seem.</p>\n<div class=\"custom-container warning\"><p class=\"custom-container-title\">It's hard to be a professional too!</p>\n<p>Sometimes professionals need to learn the subject as they work on the project too. It's not uncommon that one person suddenly stops working on a project at a company (maybe that person got sick, got a new job, or maybe got hit by a car and unexpectedly died), and it's not uncommon that the boss then re-assigns that person's duties to other workers at the company, even though if it's not their area of expertise (they need someone working on it, and hiring a new guy takes time).</p>\n</div>\n<p>Some students try to learn the subject and apply it in the project at the same time. This is usually a bad idea; the first time you use something you rarely use it the correct way, and it will be confusing for the other team members if you redo your tasks many times just because you didn't knew how to do it properly the first time. Therefor it's better if each team member has her own <em>practice project</em> of some kind she can use to really learn the subject, and then apply it to the real project when she has experience of the subject. It might feel like a waste of time, but it's not: what will take most time is to learn the subject; to implement something when you already know the subject takes very little time.</p>\n<div class=\"custom-container tip\"><p class=\"custom-container-title\">Learn first, implement then</p>\n<p>We strongly recommend students to first try to use something new they have learned in their own practice applications, and then, when they have learned how to use it properly, go ahead and use it in the project.</p>\n</div>\n","export * from \"-!../../../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/dist/templateLoader.js??ruleSet[1].rules[2]!../../../../../../node_modules/@vuepress/bundler-webpack/lib/build/ssr/vuepressLoader.js!../../../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/dist/index.js??ruleSet[0].use[1]!./index.html.vue?vue&type=template&id=4417d970\"","import { ssrRender } from \"./index.html.vue?vue&type=template&id=4417d970\"\nconst script = {}\n\nimport exportComponent from \"C:\\\\Users\\\\peter\\\\projects\\\\course-material\\\\node_modules\\\\vue-loader\\\\dist\\\\exportHelper.js\"\nconst __exports__ = /*#__PURE__*/exportComponent(script, [['ssrRender',ssrRender]])\n\nexport default __exports__","\"use strict\";\nObject.defineProperty(exports, \"__esModule\", { value: true });\n// runtime helper for setting properties on components\n// in a tree-shakable way\nexports.default = (sfc, props) => {\n    const target = sfc.__vccOpts || sfc;\n    for (const [key, val] of props) {\n        target[key] = val;\n    }\n    return target;\n};\n","export const data = {\n  \"key\": \"v-7e0b9ae0\",\n  \"path\": \"/lectures/teamwork/\",\n  \"title\": \"Teamwork\",\n  \"lang\": \"en-US\",\n  \"frontmatter\": {\n    \"sidebar\": \"auto\",\n    \"navbarTitle\": \"TeamWork\"\n  },\n  \"excerpt\": \"\",\n  \"headers\": [\n    {\n      \"level\": 2,\n      \"title\": \"Summary\",\n      \"slug\": \"summary\",\n      \"children\": []\n    },\n    {\n      \"level\": 2,\n      \"title\": \"Setup a Teamwork Environment\",\n      \"slug\": \"setup-a-teamwork-environment\",\n      \"children\": [\n        {\n          \"level\": 3,\n          \"title\": \"Setup a File Repository\",\n          \"slug\": \"setup-a-file-repository\",\n          \"children\": []\n        },\n        {\n          \"level\": 3,\n          \"title\": \"Communication\",\n          \"slug\": \"communication\",\n          \"children\": []\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"level\": 2,\n      \"title\": \"Divide the work into tasks\",\n      \"slug\": \"divide-the-work-into-tasks\",\n      \"children\": [\n        {\n          \"level\": 3,\n          \"title\": \"Parallel tasks\",\n          \"slug\": \"parallel-tasks\",\n          \"children\": []\n        },\n        {\n          \"level\": 3,\n          \"title\": \"Sequential tasks\",\n          \"slug\": \"sequential-tasks\",\n          \"children\": []\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"level\": 2,\n      \"title\": \"Verify each others' work\",\n      \"slug\": \"verify-each-others-work\",\n      \"children\": []\n    },\n    {\n      \"level\": 2,\n      \"title\": \"Use Roles/Responsibilities\",\n      \"slug\": \"use-roles-responsibilities\",\n      \"children\": []\n    },\n    {\n      \"level\": 2,\n      \"title\": \"Learn first, implement then\",\n      \"slug\": \"learn-first-implement-then\",\n      \"children\": []\n    }\n  ],\n  \"filePathRelative\": \"lectures/teamwork/README.md\",\n  \"git\": {\n    \"updatedTime\": 1642356151000\n  }\n}\n"],"names":[],"sourceRoot":""}
