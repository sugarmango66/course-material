It&#39;s usually a bad idea that the entire team works on one and the same problem. For example, if you are 4 team members and you need to design your database, it&#39;s enough if just one team member works on that; there&#39;s no need for the other 3 team members to work on this task too. If they do, they&#39;ll most likely just sit and watch and waste their time watching the fourth member draw the database diagram instead of contributing to the project.

If you don&#39;t know how to do it, then an excellent first task that can be assigned to a team member is <em>Divide the project into multiple smaller tasks</em> 😃 When you implement an application, each feature the application needs to contain can usually be expressed as a task (i.e. <em>Implement feature X</em>, like <em>Implement the guestbook page, which lists all guestbook posts users have written</em>).</p><div class="custom-container tip"><p class="custom-container-title">Working on the same task</p><p>For some tasks it can make sense for all team members to individually work on the same task independently of each other at the same time. For example, if the task is <em>Design the graphical user interface of the app</em>, it&#39;s not uncommon to test multiple different designs, and then go with the one that seems most promising. Here, each team member can come up with their own design, and then you can have a meeting where you present your designs to each other and discuss which one is the best.</p></div><h3 id="parallel-tasks" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#parallel-tasks" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Parallel tasks</h3><p>In best case you&#39;ll manage to divide the work into multiple tasks that can be completed in parallel.

An example of that is a website with a blog users can write comments on. Alice is responsible for implementing the blog page, and Bob is responsible for implementing the comment functionality on the blog posts.

Therefore you&#39;ll want to verify that the work other team members have done has been done properly. This can be done at your regular meetings: when a team member has completed a task, ask him to explain how he has completed the task, and check if he can answer questions about it. For example, if one team member has been assigned the task to design the graphical user interface of an application, ask him questions like:</p><ul><li>Why did you put that link in the menu and not at place X?</li><li>Why is the background color blue?</li><li>Etc.</li></ul><p>If he can&#39;t answer these questions, then he hasn&#39;t thought about them and he can improve his work by thinking about them and then re-design the graphical user interface.</p><div class="custom-container tip"><p class="custom-container-title">Use Code reviews in GitHub</p><p>We recommend you to use <a href="https://github.com/features/code-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Code Reviews in GitHub<span><svg class="icon outbound" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewbox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><!--[--><span class="sr-only">open in new window</span><!--]--></span></a>:</p><ol><li>When starting to work on a new task, create a new branch</li><li>Carry out the task (i.e. implement the new feature) in the new branch</li><li>Push the branch to the remote repository</li><li>On GitHub, create a pull request to merge the changes in the new branch into the <code>main</code>/<code>master</code> branch</li><li>When all team members have approved the request (after reviewing the code), apply the pull request</li></ol><p>GitHub has support for <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/approving-a-pull-request-with-required-reviews" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">only accepting code that has been approved by others<span><svg class="icon outbound" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewbox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><!--[--><span class="sr-only">open in new window</span><!--]--></span></a>. We strongly recommend you to use that.</p></div><h2 id="use-roles-responsibilities" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#use-roles-responsibilities" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Use Roles/Responsibilities</h2><p>Optimally, all team members should know everything about the project/the application implementation (such as the code). In practice that&#39;s usually not possible. The application is often too big for that, and one of the points with dividing the project into tasks is so that each team member can work on her own part of the project without knowing/without having to worry about the details in other parts of the project others are working on.</p><p>To be more productive, one can assign each team member a role, and that team member is then responsible for knowing all there is to know that is associated with that role. For example, one team member might be responsible for designing the graphical user interface and implementing the overall layout of the application (i.e. the role <em>GUI expert</em>), another team member might be responsible for designing the structure of the database and write an API the application can use to communicate with it (i.e. the role <em>Database expert</em>), a third team member might be responsible for learning Bluetooth and write an API the application can use to communicate with other devices using Bluetooth (i.e. the role <em>Bluetooth expert</em>), etc.</p><p>To have a role does not mean only that team member should work on tasks that are associated with that role. For example, the team member who is responsible for the database should not carry out all tasks that involves the database. Instead, this team member should be considered to be the database expert. This team member will probably do most of the work that involves the database (such as designing the structure of the database and to start implement the API one can use to communicate with it), but once the basics for this are done, any other team member should be able to work on tasks that involves making small changes to the database structure or the database API. If in doubt of how to do it, one can discuss the details with the database expert.</p><div class="custom-container tip"><p class="custom-container-title">Give different team members different roles/responsibilities</p><p>We recommend you to assign each team member one or more roles, so you specialize in different parts of the application. In the end, all students must know how all the code works, but it is OK if just one student is an expert and learn all there is to know about a technology, and then teaches the rest of the team members how your application makes use of that technology in best way possible.</p></div><h2 id="learn-first-implement-then" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#learn-first-implement-then" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Learn first, implement then</h2><p>Projects carried out by students are not 100% the same as projects carried out by professionals. If a professional project manager puts together a team of her choice, she&#39;ll probably pick an experienced database manager to work on the database in the project, an experienced web developer to work on the website in the project, an experienced Android developer to work on the Android application in the project, etc. These experienced workers already know the area they are responsible for in the project, so it&#39;s quite straight forward for them to contribute with their parts to the project.</p><p>Students on the other hand are not experienced professionals. Often they don&#39;t know the subject they are responsible for in the project in advance, and first need to learn the subject and then implement the part they are responsible for. This is of course much harder! It might feel a bit unfair, but remember that students have more time to work on their projects than what professionals do, and the reason for this is of course so that students can learn the subject at the same time, so it&#39;s not as bad as it first might seem.</p><div class="custom-container warning"><p class="custom-container-title">It&#39;s hard to be a professional too!</p><p>Sometimes professionals need to learn the subject as they work on the project too. It&#39;s not uncommon that one person suddenly stops working on a project at a company (maybe that person got sick, got a new job, or maybe got hit by a car and unexpectedly died), and it&#39;s not uncommon that the boss then re-assigns that person&#39;s duties to other workers at the company, even though if it&#39;s not their area of expertise (they need someone working on it, and hiring a new guy takes time).</p></div><p>Some students try to learn the subject and apply it in the project at the same time. This is usually a bad idea; the first time you use something you rarely use it the correct way, and it will be confusing for the other team members if you redo your tasks many times just because you didn&#39;t knew how to do it properly the first time. Therefor it&#39;s better if each team member has her own <em>practice project</em> of some kind she can use to really learn the subject, and then apply it to the real project when she has experience of the subject. It might feel like a waste of time, but it&#39;s not: what will take most time is to learn the subject; to implement something when you already know the subject takes very little time.</p><div class="custom-container tip"><p class="custom-container-title">Learn first, implement then</p><p>We strongly recommend students to first try to use something new they have learned in their own practice applications, and then, when they have learned how to use it properly, go ahead and use it in the project.</p></div><!--]--></div><footer class="page-meta"><div class="meta-item edit-link"><a class="nav-link external meta-item-label" href="https://github.com/PeppeL-G/course-material/edit/master/src/lectures/teamwork/README.md" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" aria-label="Improve this page!"><!--[--><!--]--> Improve this page! <span><svg class="icon outbound" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewbox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><!--[--><span class="sr-only">open in new window</span><!--]--></span><!--[--><!--]--></a></div><div class="meta-item last-updated"><span class="meta-item-label">Last Updated: </span><span class="meta-item-info">1/16/2022, 7:02:31 PM</span></div><!----></footer><!----><!--[--><!--]--></main><!--]--></div><!----><!--]--></div>
